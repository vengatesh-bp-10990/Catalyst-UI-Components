    "content": "Introduction\nThe sLyte Framework\n\nsLyte framework is a modern, versatile in-house front-end framework that helps you build powerful, interactive web pages and web applications. sLyte, being built on top of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, stands tall with its integrated libraries and components.\n\nThis framework saves plenty of your time and effort, as developing reusable UI components is easier than before. The flexible nature of sLyte enables easy navigation and state maintenance in your application. It also helps to communicate better with the backend.\n\nBeing light in weight, sLyte plays a pivotal role in the fast rendering of your application. It also extends its support to provide incremental adaptation while moving an application from any existing framework to sLyte. In terms of memory too, sLyte stays true to its name.\n\nHow does sLyte Work?\n\nTo empower the web applications, the sLyte framework is composed of three independent layers namely router, components, and data\n\nRouter\n\nThe router lets the browser navigate to have multiple views. The router helps to split your entire application and loads them separately concerning the routes. The router takes up the responsibility of path navigation and renders it.\n\nComponents\n\nComponents define the appearance and the behavior of the view in your application. This serves as the base layer, to build various UI components. Being power-packed, it employs several distinctive features that are combined to make your application stand apart. The component layer bundles the visual behavior and the style of the elements in your application.\n\nData\n\nThe Data layer eases the interaction with the server and it enables caching and data maintenance. In simple terms, it acts as a client database to hold the data that is being used by the application. It also bridges the data to DOM, and the client to the server.\n\nThe Best Of All\n\nThe most striking feature of the sLyte framework is that the layers of sLyte can be made to work independently or conjointly.\n\nIt might be overwhelming, but stick with us as we will cover all the details. For now, keep reading to understand how sLyte is going to bring in the change.\n\nThe Versatile Framework\n\nsLyte being a versatile framework, helps in creating your application from the start to the end. Be it a component, or to define a route, or to establish a connection with the backend, the framework serves as a promising launch pad for the developers. sLyte does not stop here, it also empowers you to do the following.\n\nBuilds and governs the user view\nFlexible to work independently or conjointly\nPaves the navigation\nGoverns the user's view\nPreprocess and post-process the data\nMaintains the state\nThe sLyte Ecosystem\n\nsLyte is light in weight but not in extended support. sLyte framework comes with a solid ecosystem comprising CLI, UI components, sLyte DOM, lytmus, sLyte IDE, sLyte Inspector, and sLyte Eclipse Plugins.\n\nCLI receives your commands gracefully and lets you create, manage, build, and run applications.\n\nsLyte DOM, being a lightweight Javascript library, helps in DOM traversal, event handling, and Ajax requests.\n\nsLyte Inspector is a simple yet powerful Chrome extension that lets you debug your sLyte application with great ease.\n\nsLyte understands the needs of every developer, and so a designated sLyte plugin is provided for the Eclipse IDE.\n\nTo propel forward, the sLyte framework provides a designated VS code extension for every developer to have a cakewalk.\n\nThis is just a gist of what we do. You can learn more about it in the dedicated sections.\n\nWhy sLyte Framework?\nFlexibility\n\nThe layers of the sLyte framework are not dependent on each other and each layer is made to perform specific functions. Based on your choices, the layers can be selected. The best out of it can be achieved when clubbed with each other.\n\nModularised Approach\n\nsLyte exhibits modularisation thereby achieving code segregation. As the codes are readily segregatable, it is easier to debug, and it enhances readability. sLyte also lets you reuse the components. This reduces the time and effort taken by the developers and lets the developers focus more on the business logic.\n\nScalability\n\nThe scalability of an application built on sLyte would be fairly high as it efficiently handles the size and the memory. sLyte also provides seamless transition while moving an existing application from any framework to sLyte.\n\nCustomization\n\nBased on the needs of the teams, sLyte has evolved over the years and it promises the same to suit the needs of every other team. As sLyte gives you complete control of the compiler, maintaining backward compatibility and easy migration is achieved with the fullest support, working in your favor at a solid pace.\n\nSize of framework\n\nAnother major advantage of using sLyte is its light-weighted framework, which impacts the initial application load positively. Here's a size comparison of the core framework sizes (minified and zipped) for several popular JavaScript frameworks as of the latest versions available:\n\nAngular-Approximately 200-600 KB\n\nAngular's core framework size varies based on the specific modules and features included.\n\nReact: Approximately 45-50 KB\n\nReact's core library is relatively small because it focuses on UI rendering and component logic.\n\nVue.js: Approximately 80-100 KB\n\nVue.js includes the core library size along with the runtime and essential features like Vue Router and Vuex.\n\nEmber.js: Approximately 800 KB to 1 MB\n\nEmber.js includes the core framework along with additional utilities and modules.\n\nSvelte: Approximately 10-15 KB\n\nSvelte's framework size is exceptionally small due to its compilation approach that shifts much of the framework code to compile-time.\n\nsLyte (Lyte.js): Approximately 100-150 KB\n\nAs stated above, sLyte is comparatively lighter when comapred to other frameworks.\n\nHow to Use sLyte\n\nsLyte lets you create and manage your applications using Slyte CLI, an integrated development toolkit, and plugins.\n\nYou don't have to commit yourself to sLyte. We make you fall in love with it. The rest of the documentation provides every single detail to make you feel so. Just stay in light with sLyte.\n\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data. We do have a host of other libraries, tools and extensions which ease the app development making it faster to build apps using sLyte.\n\nGit RepoRelease Notes Forum"

Even without it, things are gonna be extremely easy.\n\nInstalling Dependencies\n\nBefore you begin creating an application, you need to install the dependencies to work with CLI(An intuitive command line interface). The dependencies include\n\nNode.js and npm\n\nCLI is built with JavaScript and therefore requires Node.js version 14.18.0 or above to be installed in your system. sLyte also requires dependencies fetched via npm.\n\nBecause npm is a package in Node.js, you need to install Node.js to use it. If you have Node.js installed in your system, you can skip this step. Otherwise, refer to the installation procedures available in Node.js documentation to install Node.js and npm.\n\nTo ensure that Node.js and npm are properly installed in your system, execute the following commands in your terminal:\n\nnode --version\nnpm --version\nInstalling CLI\n\nAfter installing the dependencies, CLI has to be installed. The Command Line Interface(CLI) provides easier and faster access to sLyte, where you can develop and deploy your application from your local machine.\n\nTo install CLI, execute the following commands in your terminal:\n\nnpm install -g @slyte/cli@1.0.5 --registry http://cm-npmregistry\n\nIf there are any permission issues, include '--unsafe-perm' along with the above command\n\nFor more details on the released version, refer to our download resources\n\nQuick Check\n\nUsing the following command, you can easily check if sLyte is successfully installed.\n\nlyte --v\n\nWith this command, you will also get to know the version of CLI being used.\n\nCreating an Application\n\nNow that you have installed the CLI globally, you will have access to the Lyte command in your terminal without any difficulty.\n\nTo create a new application, navigate to the required folder in your terminal and execute the following lyte new command:\n\nlyte new lyteblog\n\nThis command will create a new directory called lyteblog, and it will set up a new sLyte application.\n\nTo start the server in a different port, execute the following command\n\nlyte server --port <<port_no>>\n\nIf not, the application gets automatically loaded http://localhost:3000/#/ in the browser, and you will be able to see the Welcome page.\n\nCongratulations.

    "content": "Things to Know Before We Start\n\nOn reading the introduction, you might have understood that the sLyte framework consists of three independent decoupled layers namely the router layer, components layer, and data layer. Every layer has its own function.\n\nRouter\n\nAs the name suggests, the Router layer is responsible for the navigation across the pages to present different views to the users. It intercepts any change in the URL and renders the corresponding view. The router layer plays a significant role in achieving modularity as the application can be divided into various routes. Each route can be rendered when the user desires to navigate it.\n\nAny given URL is made of different segments or routes. On receiving a hit in the URL, the corresponding route gets rendered. The route handler, maps the URL to the route segment. In short, the router being the skeleton of every application helps in segregating the application into routes and renders it incrementally, and offers quick loading.\n\nComponents\n\nsLyte Components define the appearance and behaviour of the user view in your application. In simple terms, it is the visual layer of your application. To present the user view, the component layer gets split into three parts to handle the HTML, styling, and behaviour. The template engine steps in to handle the HTML. The styling is taken care of by CSS, and the behavioural part is driven by Javascript.\n\nThese three files -the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are compiled and bundled together as a single JS file. If sLyte router is employed, it takes up the responsibility to fetch and render them appropriately. The striking feature of these components is that they are highly reusable.\n\nData\n\nThe Data layer helps in establishing a strong connection between the server and the client. Apart from this, it connects the data to the DOM. The data layer also performs the following distinctive functions.\n\nIn a client-server model, on using the APIs, the importance lies on the data as it requires preprocessing and post-processing at both ends. The data layer plays a significant role in bridging the data between the client and the server. It not only bridges but also caches the data and maintains it. It also provides you with the same while receiving a request.\n\nNavigate here to learn about app creation.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Creating an Application\nCreate an Application in sLyte\n\nCreating an application in sLyte is gonna be exciting and super easy. Just follow the steps to see the magic unveil.\n\nCreating an Application\n\nNow that you have installed the CLI globally, you will have access to the sLyte command in your terminal without any difficulty.\n\nTo create a new application, navigate to the required folder in your terminal and execute the following lyte new command:\n\nlyte new lyteblog\n\nThis command will create a new directory called lyteblog, and it will set up a new sLyte application.\n\nTo start the server in a different port, execute the following command\n\nlyte server --port <<port_no>>\n\nIf not, the application gets automatically loaded http://localhost:3000/#/ in the browser, and you will be able to see the Welcome page.\n\nCongratulations. With this, you have now successfully created your first sLyte application.\n\nBy default, an index route and a welcome component gets created. The index route is available under 'router/routes' as index.js and is mapped to / (slash) path. When you access the application http://localhost:3000/, the welcome-comp gets appended to the element that matches the given CSS selector.\n\nDefining Route\n\nNow that your application is ready, you can navigate to various pages of your application by defining a route. The syntax for defining a route is:\n\nlyte generate route <route_name> </route/path>\n\nFor example, let's create a route called users . To do so, execute the following command:\n\nlyte generate route users /users\n\nNow, a new file named users.js gets created under router/routes folder and the mapping details can be found in router/maps/map.js. Dive into the router section of docs to know more about it.\n\nCreating a Component\n\nComponents are the building blocks of sLyte framework that let you to create the elements of your choice. It contains HTML files, JavaScript files, and CSS files bundled together as a single element.\n\nYou can create a component by executing the following command in your terminal:\n\nlyte generate component componentName\n\nFor instance, you can execute this command\n\nlyte generate component blogger-comp\nlyte generate component blogger-comp -d blogFolder\n\nThis command creates a component named blogger-comp.\n\nThe name of the component must be hyphenated\n\nThe component files are available as follows:\n\nHTML file -> components/templates\nJavaScript file -> components/javascript\nCSS file -> components/styles\n\nInside the template file, you will have a template tag with blogger-comp as the tag name. Your template content, i.e. the HTML content resides inside the template tag.\n\nThe Javascript section of the component typically contains a data block, an action block, and a method block.\n\nYou can learn more about this in the components section.\n\nLikewise, the styles associated with the component are included in a CSS file. Once we render the component and build the application, the compiled component will be available under dist/components/javascript.\n\nCreating a Schema\n\nSchemas are objects that represent the underlying data presented to the users by the application. In sLyte, you can define attributes in a schema. You can specify the data type of an attribute, and set constraints to it based on its type.\n\nYou can create a schema by executing the following lyte generate commands in your terminal:\n\nlyte generate schema bloggerList\nlyte generate schema bloggerList -d blogger\n\nThe above command will create a schema named bloggerList\n\nYou can learn more about data store here.\n\nRendering a Component\n\nNow that the route and the component have been successfully created and are ready to be used, you can link them together. To do so, you need to render the component.\n\nOn creating a app, the sLyte framework, by default renders the 'welcome component'.\n\nThe HTML content gets rendered inside the given outlet. You can get it rendered in the route http://localhost:3000\n\nYou can also get any component of yours rendered. Just provide the name of the component in the render function and get it rendered.\n\nIf you need to reuse this component in other components, you can use it like any other HTML tag, such as:\n\n<blogger-comp> </blogger-comp>\nCapturing User Events\n\nYou can capture user interaction using events handling. These user events include mouse clicks, page scrolls, mouse hovers, and more. You can also define your own custom events in sLyte.\n\nBuilding the Application\n\nNow that you have created your first sLyte application, you will need to build it before you can run it. You can build your application by using the lyte build command. This will compile the routes, schemas, and components, and compress them.\n\nTo build your application automatically, execute the following command in your terminal:\n\nlyte build --watch\n\nOnce the application is built, the compiled files will be available under the default output folder dist. The path of the file is dist/components/javascript..\n\nNow that you have built an application in sLyte, irt is also important to understand the core of sLyte.

    "content": "Component\n\nComponents in sLyte are created by executing the following command in the terminal\n\nlyte generate component user-component\n\nHere, a component named user-component is created. And the name of the component must always be hyphenated(-).\n\nA component consists of three files.\n\nTemplate\nJavascript\nCSS\n\nThe template contains HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. HTML decides the layout and rendering logic. Javascript handles the behaviour and user interaction of the component. CSS file contain the needed style elements of the components.\n\nTemplate\n\nWith sLyte you can use the HTML tags and build your own components. Here, you can provide both the static and dynamic values and get it rendered.\n\nTo render static content, make full use of HTML tags just like the below code snippet\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n\t<p> Hello,Glad that you are here. I would like to share my hobbies with you. They are </p>\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li> Reading </li>\n\t\t<li> Playing and </li>\n\t\t<li> Sleeping </li>\n\t</ul>\n</template>\n```\n\nTo render dynamic values use double curly braces ( {{ }} ) which is called a mustache.\n\nHere is a sample template file for your reference\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n\t<p> {{name}} </p>\n\t<p> {{age}} </p>\n</template>\n```\n\nHead to know more about rendering the dynamic values.\n\nJavascript\n\nThe Javascript file of the component registers the component and provides data definition, action and methods associated with the component.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\n              import { prop } from \"@slyte/core\"\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tsuper();\n\t}\n\tdata() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tname: prop(\"string\", { default: \"Ram\" }),\n\t\t\tage: prop(\"number\", { default: 25 }),\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tstatic methods() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tstatic actions() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tstatic observers() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport { UserComp };\n```\n\nIn the above example, the UserComp class specifies the data, actions, and methods of the user component. You can observe here that the UserComp class extends the Component class. This component serves as a container/scope within which a set of components gets registered.\n\nStyle\n\nBy default the component in a vault will be rendered in a shadow and hence the styling associated with the component will only be applied to that particular component. You can learn more about it here.\n\nDuring the build time, CLI combines the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS into a single JS file.\n\nLet's navigate to learn about component registry.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 7,
    "content": "Component Registry\n\nAs the name suggests, the component registry serves as a register to hold all the components. It acts as a scope under which the components get registered. The best part is that you can have multiple component registries for an app.\n\nCreating a Registry\n\nBy default, while creating an app, the component registry gets created. You can also create additional registries.\n\nThis is how the component registry looks like.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ComponentRegistry } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass AppComponentRegistry extends ComponentRegistry {\n    lookups() {\n        return []\n    }\n}\nexport {AppComponentRegistry};\n```\nComponent Class\n\nThe component class is available in \"@slyte/component\". Component registry class should be defined in the \"component.js\" file and so components inside the same folder will be associated with the registry mentioned in \"component.js\".\n\nLet us look at the following code\n\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n  data() {\n    return {\n      name: this.$app.prop(\"string\", { default: \"Ram\" }),\n      age: this.$app.prop(\"number\", { default: 25 }),\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n\n    }\n  }\n  static observers() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { UserComp };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { ComponentRegistry } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass AppComponentRegistry extends ComponentRegistry {\n    lookups() {\n        return []\n    }\n}\nexport {AppComponentRegistry};\n```\n\nOn having a look at the above code snippets, you can clearly figure out that welcomeComp is associated with AppComponentRegistry and so welcomeComp is scoped inside AppComponentRegistry registry. We can also create another registry with same component name (welcome-comp) and so it will be associated with its own registry. While rendering welcome-comp, we have to render via registryInstance and so appropriate welcome-comp will be rendered.\n\nInstantiating the Registry\n\nInstantiating the registry takes place by placing it as a lookup in the App class.\n\nIn the above example, the AppComponentRegistry gets instantiated when the App gets instantiated and it will be placed as a lookup (service) in the app instance.\n\n```javascript\nimport {Lyte} from \"@slyte/core/src/lyte\";\nimport {AppComponentRegistry} from \"components/component.js\";\nclass App extends Lyte {\n  lookups() {\n    return [AppComponentRegistry];\n  }\n}\n```\nGo Extramile\nget Default Registry\n\nsLyte framework by default, takes the registry of the baseApp. You are also given an option to override the registry and provide a registry of your choice as a default registry using the method getDefaultRegistry.\n\n```javascript\nclass crmApp extends Lyte {\n  lookups() {\n        return [{component : CrmComponentRegistry}];\n  }\n    getDefaultRegistry() {\n       return this.$component;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf the component is rendered without any scope then the framework will look into default registry and renders it.\n\nAssociate Registry\n\nLet us consider a scenario, where you are wanting to use UI components as addons to our base app. Even on adding the UI components in lookups you will have two seperate registries, a baseapp registry and an uicomponent registry. Now, with the associate registry feature, you can associate uicomponent registry with the baseapp registry. With this, you communicate to the framework that on rendering a component on base app registry, it has lo look both the baseapp registry and uicomponent registry.\n\n```javascript\nclass crmApp extends Lyte {\n  lookups() {\n        return [{component : CrmComponentRegistry}, UiComponentAddon];\n  }\n    addRegistries() {\n   return [this.$uiComponentAddon.$component];\n  }\n}\n```\n\naddRegistries api can be used in app.js or component.js or any component js files.\n\nPassing Registry for the Components\n\nYou can also pass the registry for the components with the help of 'lyte-registry'. If all component in the html are in same registry, then there is no need to use lyte-registry. Lyte-registry comes in to picture if you use multiple registries in your app.\n\n'lyte-registry' is a special attribute, which can get the registry class or registry name or registry instance. So that the lyte-registry will set the registry scope to render the component.\n\nLet us see an example where 'RecruitRegistry' being a sample registry.\n\n```html\n<child-comp lyte-registry=\"RecruitRegistry\"></child-comp>\n```\n\nHere, RecruitRegistry is the class name of recruit registry. Since you have passed only the registry name, the first instance of the recruit registry will be associated to the child Component. i.e it is the way to tell the framework that the child component is from recruit registry so render the child comp with this recruitRegistry scope.\n\nLet us consider another example where a registry class named as RecruitRegistryClass is passed to lyte-registry.\n\n```html\n<child-comp lyte-registry=\"{{RecruitRegistryClass }}\" ></child-comp>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {ChildComp} from \"./child-comp.js\"\ndata(){\n   ChildComp : prop(\"object\",{default : ChildComp}),\n   RecruitRegistryClass : prop(\"object\",{default : this.$app.$recruit}),\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, RecruitRegistryClass is the class of recruit registry, so that the first instance of the recruit registry will be associated to the child component. Thereby the child component renders with the recruitRegistry scope.\n\nWhile providing the class for lyte-registry, it is advised to import the class and use it in the data block.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"welcome-comp\">\n<child-comp lyte-registry=\"{{recruitRegistryInstance }}\"></child-comp>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {ChildComp} from \"./child-comp.js\"\ndata(){\n   ChildComp : prop(\"object\",{default : ChildComp}),\n   recruitRegistryInstance : prop(\"object\",{default : this.$app.$recruit}),\n}\n```\n```javascript\nimport RecruitRegistry from \"recruit/compoennt.js\"\nclass blogApp extends Lyte\nlookups(){\nreturn [RecruitRegistry]\n}\n```\n\nHere, the recruit registry instance is saved in the component's data and passed to lyte-registry attribute, which tells the framework to render the child-comp from recruit registry using recruitRegistryInstance instance.\n\nLet's navigate to learn about templates.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

They are </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li> Reading </li>\n      <li> Playing and </li>\n      <li> Sleeping </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p> I know, you are curious enough to know who I am </p>\n    <p>I am {{name}} and I am {{age}} years old.</p>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n  data() {\n    return {\n      name: prop(\"string\", { default: \"Ram\" }),\n      age: prop(\"number\", { default: 25 }),\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n\n    }\n  }\n  static observers() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { UserComp };\n```\n\nAnything that is enclosed in {{ }} is considered as dynamic data. {{ }} is generally called a mustache. The components not only renders the dynamic data, it also establishes a link between the data and the DOM. sLyte goes a step ahead and whenever there is a change in the data, the component re-renders the corresponding DOM nodes.\n\nRendering Mixed Data\n\nYou can also club the string and the dynamic values and get it rendered just like the below code.\n```javascript\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\">\n   <p> Hi there </p>\n   <div class=\"abc{{dynamicdata}}abc\"></div>\n<template>\n```\n\nRendering Complex Data\n\nYou can also pass an array in an array, a helper in an array and other complex dynamic values just like the below code snippet.\n\nPassing an array in an array:\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\">\n  <p> Hi there </p>\n  <div class=\"{{array[newArray[key.a]]}}\"></div>\n<template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      array:prop(\"array\",{default:[\"one\",\"two\"]}),\n      newarray:prop(\"array\",{default:[1,2,3]}),\n      key:prop(\"object\",{default : {a:0}})\n\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      // Functions for event handling\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n      // Functions which can be used as callback in the component.\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {UserComp};\n```\n\nPassing a helper in an array:\n\nHelpers are simple functions that can be called from a template. You can learn more about it here..\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\">\n  <p> Hi there </p>\n  <div class=\"{{array[newArray[returnZeroHelper()]]}}\"></div>\n<template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      array : prop(\"array\",{default : [\"one\",\"two\"]}),\n      newArray : prop(\"array\",{default : [1,2,3]})\n\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      // Functions for event handling\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n      // Functions which can be used as callback in the component.\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {UserComp};\n```\n\nPassing complex dynamic values:\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\">\n  <p> Hi there </p>\n  <div class=\"{{array[newArray[returnZeroHelper(someNewArray[someNewObj['a']])]]}}\"></div>\n<template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      array : prop(\"array\",{default : [\"one\",\"two\"]}),\n      newArray : prop(\"array\",{default : [1,2,3]}),\n      someNewArray : prop(\"array\",{default : [1,2,3]})\n      someNewObj : prop(\"object\",{default : {a:0}})\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      // Functions for event handling\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n      // Functions which can be used as callback in the component.\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {UserComp};\n```\nExpressions Evaluation\n\nsLyte supports logical operations, ternary operations, arithmetic operations, comparison operators, and assignment operators.\n\nHave a look at how you can use these expressions in sLyte\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\">\n    <span> Blog 1 </span>\n    <span case=\"{{(a=='two'&&b=='one')||(c=='three')}}\"> logical operations </span>\n    <span case=\"{{num1>num2?num1:num2}}\"> ternary operations </span>\n    <span case=\"{{++num1 + ++num2}}\"> Arithmetic operations </span>\n    <span lyte-if=\"{{num1 >num2}}\"> Comparison Operators </span>\n    <span case=\"{{num1+=20}}\"> Assignment Operators </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      // Data that is processed in template.\n      num1 : this.$app.prop( \"number\" , { default:5 }),\n      num2 : this.$app.prop( \"number\" , { default:6 }),\n      a    : this.$app.prop( \"string\" , { default:\"two\" }),\n      b    : this.$app.prop( \"string\" , { default:\"one\" }),\n      c    : this.$app.prop( \"string\" , { default:\"three\" })\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {UserComp};\n```\nGo Extramile\nQuotes Handling\n\nAt times, you may use the quotes symbol (') in your content. In such cases, sLyte can handle both single and double quotes inside a {{ }}\n\n\nHTML context :\n\nIn HTML content, quotes can be used with their entity name. Entity name like &quot for double quotes(\") and &apos for a single quote(') is used.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n    <div class = \"{{string2 == 'sister&quot;s'}}\"> single quotes </div>\n    <div class = '{{string1 == \"sister&apos;s\"}}'>  double quotes </div>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      string1 : prop( \"string\", { default:\"sister's\" }),\n      string2 : prop( \"string\", { default:'sister\"s' })\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      // Functions for event handling\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n      // Functions which can be used as callback in the component.\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\n\nString context:\n\nWhile using a string content inside the mustache, it is advisable to use it with a ('\\')sign. It can be used like this,\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n    <div class = \"{{string1 == 'sister\\'s'}}\"> single quotes  </div>\n    <div class = '{{string2 == \"sister\\\"s\"}}'> double quotes  </div>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      string1 : prop( \"string\", { default:\"sister's\" }),\n      string2 : prop( \"string\", { default:'sister\"s' })\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\n\nNote: Mustache must be enclosed inside the double quotes/single quotes when you add spaces inside it (which is the default HTML behaviour).\n\neg : <p onclick = \"{{action('actionName','args')}}\"> </p>\n\nProviding Common Attributes for the Component\n\nWhile creating a component you may at times require an ID or a class to define the component.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"some-component\" style={{someStyle}} class=\"staticClass\" id=gen-{{id}}></template>\n```\n\nAs seen in the above example, you can provide static as well as dynamic values for these attributes. Whenever you use this component, these attributes will be populated for that component instance.\n\nLet's navigate to learn about actions and methods.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 9,
    "content": "Javascript\nBasic Syntax\n\nThe action time begins. As the template gets ready, it gets registered to make it available as a custom element. The component class contains the list of data properties, actions, and methods for the component. And this is how it looks like:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\n  class UserComp extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n  data() {\n    return {\n\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n\n    }\n  }\n  static observers() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { UserComp };\n```\n\nNote: Only the \"data\" block can be accessed from the template directly, \"actions\" and \"methods\" blocks must be accessed via actions and methods helper.\n\nData Block\n\nThe data block contains the data needed for the components. The 'data' function contains the variable definition and initialization for the properties to be used in the component. It can contain strings, integers, arrays, and objects. In this data block, the data given dynamically in the template file gets rendered. There are multiple ways to render the data dynamically. Let us have a look at it.\n\nBefore declaring the variables, it is good to import the prop just like the below code snippet.\n\nHere is a sample data block for your reference:\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"UserComp\">\n  <span> My name is {{Name}} </span>\n  <span>and I am {{Age}}. </span>\n  <span> You can stay in touch with me via  {{email}} </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\ndata() {\nreturn {\n   Name: prop( \"string\" , { default : \"Ram\" }),\n   Age: prop(\"number\", { default: 10 }),\n   email: prop( \"string\" , { default : \"abc@gmail.com\" })\n       }\n    }\n    static actions() {\n    return {\n          // Functions for event handling\n        }\n    }\n    static methods() {\n    return {\n          // Functions which can be used as callback in the component.\n        }\n      }\n    }\nexport {UserComp};\n```\n\nIf you have not provided the default value, you can also pass it through the init(). In general, init() gets rendered before the rendering of the component. Here is an example of how you can do it. In this example, with the help of init(), the value of the name, age, and data are set.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"UserComp\">\n<span> My name is {{Name}} and </span>\n<span>I am {{Age}}. </span>\n<span> You can stay in touch with me via{{email}} </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n  init() {\n    this.setData(\"Name\", \"Sam\");\n    this.setData(\"Age\", 25);\n    this.setData(\"email\", \"sam@gmail.com\");\n  }\n\n  data() {\n    return {\n      Name:prop(\"string\"),\n      Age: prop(\"number\"),\n      email:prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n  static observers() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { UserComp };\n```\nActions Block\n\nSo far, you have rendered a component with dynamic data. Now it is time to add some user interaction to the component and action block helps you to do so.\n\nLet us see an example.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\">\n   <span> {{title}} </span>\n   <span onclick=\"{{action('perform')}}\"> Click Me </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n  data() {\n    return{\n\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      perform: function () {\n      alert(\"Hello, How are you?\")\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  static observers() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { UserComp };\n```\n\nIn the above example, you have added a click function that listens to click action. Default action helper is used to bind events to a node.\n\n\n\n\nLet us consider another example\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-Post\">\n   <span> {{title}} </span>\n   <span onclick=\"{{action('clicked','You have Clicked:' , content)}}\"> {{content}} </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      title : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog title\" }),\n      content : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog Content\" })\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      clicked : function( str , blogContent ){\n      alert( str + blogContent ); // will alert => You have Clicked:Blog Content\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\nMethods Block\n\nIt contains functions associated with the component. Only functions within this block can be passed from a parent component to a child component.\n\nLet's take this example. Here, you have a component called lyte-menu which displays the list of items. Lyte-menu expects a callback function, which gets called before a menu is rendered. Here the function onBeforeShow is passed from the user component to the lyte-menu component using the method helper. Dwell to know what methods block can do for you\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n   <lyte-menu on-before-show={{method('onBeforeShow')}}></lyte-menu>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass UserComponent extends Component {\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n      \"onBeforeShow\" : function(){\n        console.log( this );\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {UserComponent};\n```\n\nLet's navigate to learn about basic declarations.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data. We do have a host of other libraries, tools and extensions which ease the app development making it faster to build apps using sLyte.\n\nGit RepoRelease Notes Forum"

    "content": "Yield - Rendering Dynamic HTML\nYield - Rendering Dynamic HTML\n\nWhile building an application, you might be using the same component across the application at different places and it might have its own disadvantages. You may want to reuse the component again but not always require it to look similar or to have the same functionality across the application.\n\nTo avoid the rigidity of the component while reusing it, the sLyte framework has come up with Yield.\n\nWith yield, you can customize the same component as per your wish and reuse it across the application. Yield lets you pass dynamic HTML from the parent to the child component.\n\nThe Role of Yield\n\nUse case 1\n\nThe first use case where yield can help you out is that you can pass the HTML content from the parent component to the child component.\n\nLet us consider an example in which we use the lyte button.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name='welcome-comp'>\n    <p>Let us try yield</p>\n    <user1-component>\n        <template is=\"yield\" yield-name=\"content\">\n            <button>Click Me</button>\n        </template>\n    </user1-component>\n</template>\n```\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user1-component\">\n   <p>Hello World</p>\n   <lyte-yield yield-name=\"content\">\n\n   </lyte-yield>\n </template>\n```\n\nFrom the above code, you infer that the same button can be used in multiple places with customization. And it is achieved with yield.\n\nUse case 2\n\nLet us discuss the second use case where yield can be used effectively.\n\nWith yield, passing and rendering the data from the child component(user-comp) to the parent component(yieldtry-comp) is also possible. Let us consider an example.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"yieldtry-comp\">\n<p>Here is an example for yield</p>\n     <user-comp>\n         <template is=\"yield\" yield-name=\"content\">\n             <div>{{Name}}</div>\n             <b> Id Number - {{idValue}} </b>\n             <b> Email - {{emailValue}}  </b>\n         </template>\n     </user-comp>\n </template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\n\nclass YieldtryComp extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    data() {\n        return {\n            Name : prop(\"string\", {\"default\" : \"Rakesh\"}),\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    static methods() {\n        return {\n        }\n    }\n\n    static actions() {\n        return {\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    static observers() {\n        return {\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\nexport { YieldtryComp };\n```\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\">\n    <lyte-yield yield-name=\"content\" id-value={{idno}} email-value={{email}} >  </lyte-yield>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\n\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    data() {\n        return {\n            idno : prop('string',{default: '022'}),\n            email : prop('string',{default: 'abc@email.com'})\n\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    static methods() {\n        return {\n        }\n    }\n\n    static actions() {\n        return {\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    static observers() {\n        return {\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\nexport { UserComp };\n```\n```html\n\n                                        \n\n                                        \n```\n\nFrom the above code, you can infer,that with yield the data passing is easily feasible.\n\nHere, in this example, using the 'template yield' in the parent component(yieldtry-comp), we dynamically set the values for the child component.\n\nNow in the child component(user-comp) with Lyte-yield, we call the dynamically set values from the parent component.\n\nWith yield, it is possible to render the data present in the parent component(if needed).\n\nTo overcome the rigidity, if needed you can also add actions inside the yield of the parent component.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"yieldtry-comp\">\n  <p>Here is an example for yield</p>\n  <user-comp>\n     <template is=\"yield\" yield-name=\"content\">\n     <div>{{Name}}</div>\n     <div> Id Number - {{idValue}}\" </div>\n     <div> Email - {{emailValue}}  </div>\n     <button onclick={{action('perform')}} >Click Me</button>\n     </template>\n  </user-comp>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\n\nclass YieldtryComp extends Component {\n    constructor() {\n        super();\n    }\n\n    data() {\n        return {\n            Name: prop(\"string\", { \"default\": \"Rakesh\" })\n        }\n    }\n\n    static methods() {\n        return {\n        }\n    }\n\n    static actions() {\n        return {\n            perform: function () {\n                alert(\"Hello, I am Rakesh.\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    static observers() {\n        return {\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n\nexport {YieldtryComp};\n```\n```html\n\n                                        \n  \n                                    \n```\nAn example of yield in UI components\n\nHere's a simple example of a lyte-calender using an yield. The lyte-calendar renders a calendar widget, but also allows you to add your own DOM content to its footer. Here's how its achieved.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"footer\">\n        <div style=\"padding: 5px 0px 5px 15px;\">\n            <a> Day </a>\n            <a> Week </a>\n            <a> Month </a>\n        </div>\n    </template>\n</lyte-calendar>\n```\n\nLet's navigate to learn about helpers.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 11,
    "content": "Helpers\nWhat are helpers\n\nHelpers are simple functions that can be called from a template. Helpers can be used to compute values and handle minimum logic in the templates. A helper should be registered before using it. After registering the helper, it can be used in all components.\n\nOn viewing the below code snippet you can clearly figure out how the concat and prefix helpers are registered.\n\n```javascript\nimport {Helper} from \"@slyte/component\";\nHelper.register( \"concat\" , function( firstName , lastName ){\n\treturn firstName + lastName ;\n});\n```\n```javascript\nimport {Helper} from \"@slyte/component\";\nHelper.register( \"prefix\" , function( prefix , name ){\n\treturn prefix + name ;\n});\n```\n\nNow that the helpers are registered, they can be used in any component. As shown in the below example:\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\">\n\t<div>  {{concat(firstName , secondName)}}  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nAdditionally, a helper can be called as nested helper. In this example, the concatenated value is passed to the prefix helper\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\">\n\t<div> {{prefix( 'Mr' , concat(firstName , secondName) )}} </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nA helper can take both static and dynamic values as input. In the above prefix example, Mr is a static value, and firstName and secondName are dynamic values.\n\nNote: Hyphens are not allowed in helper names. You can use \"camelCase\" for multi-word helper names.\n\nsLyte framework provides a rich set of default helpers, which is used to handle actions, methods and, log function in the template. Keep reading to learn more about it.\n\nDefault Helpers\nAction\n\nThis helper is used to handle both default and custom events in a component. The first argument is the function name followed by the arguments to be passed.\n\nLet us see a sample code. Here, the function editBlog is called which sends an alert message with ID and content.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-Post\">\n\t<span> {{title}} </span>\n\t<span onclick=\"{{action('editBlog',id, content)}}\"> Edit </span>\n\t<span> {{content}} </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n\tdata() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tid : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"1233\" }),\n\t\t\ttitle :  prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog title\" }),\n\t\t\tcontent :  prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog Content\" })\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tstatic actions() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\teditBlog : function( blogId , blogContent ){\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log( event ); // Event Object\n\t\t\t\talert( \"Blog:\" + blogId + \"With content\" + blogContent + \"is Edited.\" );\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\nMethod\n\nThis helper is used to pass a method from the parent component to the child component. Similar to action helper, method helper takes the function name as the first argument followed by arguments to be passed.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n\t<lyte-menu on-before-show=\"{{method('onBeforeShow')}}\"></lyte-menu>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass UserComponent extends Component {\n\tstatic methods() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\"onBeforeShow\" : function(){\n\t\t\t\tconsole.log( this );\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport {UserComponent};\n```\nUnbound\n\nBy default, the Component establishes a link between data and DOM. Any changes in data gets immediately rendered in the DOM. At times, this linking is not preferred. In such cases, the Unbound option is used.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-Post\">\n\t<span> {{unbound(title)}} </span>\n\t<span onclick=\"{{action('editBlog', id , content)}}\"> Edit </span>\n\t<span> {{content}} </span>\n</template>\n```\nUnbound a Component\n\nsLyte achieves data binding between the data of the component and the rendered DOM. Any changes made in the data automatically get reflected in the DOM. If you wish to avoid this behavior of sLyte, you can very well use @unbound or @unbound=\"true\".\n\nIn cases where you want to avoid this behavior, you can resort to Unbound for \"for\" helper. But if you want to avoid binding the entire component, you can set a property \"@unbound\" for the component, which will make this component unreactive to any data changes. The child component should however support lyteUnbound by defining it as a property in it's data scope.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"main-component\">\n\t<child-component @unbound=\"true\" ></child-component>\n</template>\n```\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"child-component\">\n\t<template lyte-if=\"{{show}}\">\n\t\tThe content is visible\n\t</template>\n\t<template lyte-else>\n\t\tThe content should not be visible.\n\t</template>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass ChildComponent extends Component {\ndata() {\n\treturn {\n\t\tlyteUnbound : prop( \"boolean\" , { \"default\" : false })\n\t\tshow : prop( \"boolean\" , { \"default\" : true })\n\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport {ChildComponent};\n```\n\nIn the above example, any changes in the data of \"some-component\" will not affect the DOM. For example, if the value of the \"show\" property of \"some-component\" changes, the DOM will not be updated.\n\nThe child component can also define the default value of lyteUnbound as true, making it unbound by default.\n\nNote: The child component should have a property \"lyteUnbound\" of boolean type.\n\nUnescape\n\nThe Component renders the dynamic values (values provided within mustache {{ }}) as a text value. Lets take an example here.\n\n```html\n<div> {{unescape(appValue)}} </div>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass UserComponent extends Component {\n\tdata() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tappValue : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"< b > Render this bold < \\b >\" })\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport {UserComponent};\n```\n```html\n<b> Render this bold <\\b>\n```\n\nIn this case , the value of appValue property in the component is rendered as text content as \"<b> Render this bold <\\b>\". There might be the cases where you might have to print the dynamic value as HTML content. In such cases, 'unescape'helper comes handy.\n\nBy default, Zoho's Security Sanitizer is used for sanitizing the content along with the Unescape helper, in order to prevent XSS from any malicious content. You can find more details about the sanitizer in Client Side Sanitizing.\n\nThe unescape helper takes four arguments.\n\nFirst Argument:\n\nThe actual content to be unescaped\n\nHere, is an example.\n\n```html\n<div> {{unescape(appValue)}} </div>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass UserComponent extends Component {\n\tdata() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tappValue : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"< b > Render this bold < \\b >\" })\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport {UserComponent};\n```\n```html\n<b> Render this bold </b>\n```\nSecond Argument [Optional] :\n\nAdditional configuration to be provided to the Sanitizer. The sanitizer has a default white-list containing the list of allowed tags and attributes. Apart from the default white-listed tags and attributes, the others are removed during sanitization to prevent XSS. You may use this option to specify other HTML tags and attributes, which the sanitizer has to preserve during the process of sanitization.\n\nExample for passing additional configuration object as second argument for unescape helper.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-Post\">\n\t<span> {{title}} </span>\n\t<span> {{unescape(content,additionalConfig)}} </span>\n</template>\n<!-- content   and  local   config   was   given   in   blog-Post.js -->\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n\tdata() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tappValue : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"< b > Render this bold < \\b >\" })\n\t\t\tcontent : prop( \"string\" , {\n\t\t\t\t   default : \"< lyte-comp obj='test' > this is lyte component < /lyte-comp > < custom-comp compvalue='test'  > this is custom component < /custom-comp >\"\n\t\t\t}),\n\t\t\tadditionalConfig : prop( \"object\" , {\n\t\t\t\tdefault : { 'GLOBAL_TAGS' : [ 'lyte-comp' , 'custom-comp'] , 'GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTES' : [ 'compvalue' ] , 'FORBID_TAGS' : [ 'input' ] , 'FORBID_ATTR' : [ 'value' ] }\n\t\t\t   })\n\t\t\t// localconfig need to be a object\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\nThird Argument [Optional] :\n\nSanitizer Instance: By default, we will use the global Sanitizer instance. However you can also create a local sanitizer with custom configuration specific to your needs and make Lyte to use your custom sanitizer.\n\nNote : Additional object can support only GLOBAL_TAGS, GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTES, FORBID_TAGS and FORBID_ATTR configurations. If you want to add additonal other sanitizer flag configuration, then you have to create custom sanitizer as discussed below.\n\nNote : If the html content contains lyte components, then you have to add the component's name in \"GLOBAL_TAGS\" whereas the attributes associated with component will be preserved .\n\nExample for creating custom sanitizer and passing as third argument for unescape helper.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-Post\">\n\t<span> {{unescape(content_with_style_tag,undefined,instance_style.obj)}} </span>\n\t<span> {{unescape(content_with_onevents,undefined,instance_onevents.obj)}} </span>\n\t<span> {{unescape(content_with_src,undefined,instance_src.obj)}} </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component, Sanitizer } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n\tdata(){\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tcontent_with_style_tag : prop( \"string\" , { default : \"<head> <style>p{color:red} </style> </head><p>this is ptag </p><p style='color:green'>this is ptag with inline style </p> <my-comp>this is new custom tag </my-comp>\" });\n\t\t\tcontent_with_onevents : prop( \"string\" , { default : \"<div onclick = 'myfn()'> this is div  </div>\" });\n\t\t\tcontent_with_src : prop( \"string\" , { default : \"<lyte-comp> <p>this is lyte component</p>  <img class=\"ZCrmImage\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i26qpaxZhVC28XRTJWafQS.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"/> </lyte-comp>\" });\n\t\t\tinstance_style : prop( \"object\" , { default : { \"obj\" : {} }});\n\t\t\tinstance_onevents : prop( \"object\" , { default : { \"obj\" : {} }});\n\t\t\tinstance_src : prop( \"object\" , { default : { \"obj\" : {} }});\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tinit(){\n\t\tthis.setData( \"instance_style.obj\" , new Sanitizer ( { GLOBAL_TAGS : [ \"my-comp\" ] , \"GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTES\" : [ \"some-attr\" ] ,\"ALLOWED_STYLE\" : \"ALL\" ,\"STYLE_VALIDATION\" : false}));\n\t\tthis.setData( \"instance_onevents.obj\" , new Sanitizer ( {\"GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTES\" : [ \"onclick\" ],'REMOVE_ONEVENTS':false}));\n\t\tthis.setData( \"instance_src.obj\" , new Sanitizer ( { GLOBAL_TAGS : [ \"lyte-comp\" ] ,\"ADD_URI_SAFE_ATTR\" : [ \"src\" ] }));\n\t}\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\n\nWe can also pass both additional object in second param and instance in third param of unescape helper. Click here to know more.\n\nNote : We have shown few sample configurations with custom sanitizer instance in the above example, such as preserving dom events, style and src attributes etc. Please check the security documentation for more custom configurations supported by sanitizer.\n\nFourth Argument:[Options]\n\nWith this argument, you can pass an option which gives you the complete freedom to ignore or choose to use the sanitizer.\n\nThe Synatx and an example is given below.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-Post\">\n\t<span> {{unescape(html, additional object,userInstance,options)}} </span>\n</template>\n```\n\nNote: In the options, you can set the flag 'ignoreSanitizer' as true or false. On setting true, the sanitizer will not be enabled, thereby XSS attack from any malicious content will not be prevented from our end. On setting 'ignoreSanitizer' as false, the sanitizer will be enabled.\n\nHave a look at the below code snippet.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-Post\">\n\t<span> {{unescape(content_with_style_tag,undefined,instance_style.obj,{ignoreSanitizer : true})}} </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n\tdata(){\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tcontent_with_style_tag : prop( \"string\" , { default : \"<head> <style>p{color:red} </style> </head><p>this is ptag </p><p style='color:green'>this is ptag with inline style </p> <my-comp>this is new custom tag </my-comp>\" });\n\t\t\tcontent_with_onevents : prop( \"string\" , { default : \"<div onclick = 'myfn()'> this is div  </div>\" });\n\t\t\tcontent_with_src : prop( \"string\" , { default : \"<lyte-comp> <p>this is lyte component</p>  <img class=\"ZCrmImage\" src=\"https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i26qpaxZhVC28XRTJWafQS.jpeg\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"/> </lyte-comp>\" });\n\t\t\tinstance_style : prop( \"object\" , { default : { \"obj\" : {} }});\n\t\t\tinstance_onevents : prop( \"object\" , { default : { \"obj\" : {} }});\n\t\t\tinstance_src : prop( \"object\" , { default : { \"obj\" : {} }});\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tinit(){\n\t\tthis.setData( \"instance_style.obj\" , this.$app.Security.createSanitizer ( { GLOBAL_TAGS : [ \"my-comp\" ] , \"GLOBAL_ATTRIBUTES\" : [ \"some-attr\" ] ,\"ALLOWED_STYLE\" : \"ALL\" ,\"STYLE_VALIDATION\" : false}));\n\t}\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\nEscape\n\nThere are places where the framework uses innerHTML such as TURBO rendering where the framework will escape the dynamic values and renders in DOM with escape helper.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n  <div class=\"{{escape(value,type)}}\">\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nBased on the 'type', the corresponding ZOHO security API's are used.\n\nIf the 'type' is url when concerned about images or any HTML then Encoder.encodeForHtmlAttribute(value) is used.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n   <div class=\"{{escape( Encoder.encodeForHtmlAttribute,url)}}\">\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nIf the type is javascript, then Encoder.encodeForJavascript(value) is used.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n   <div class=\"{{escape( Encoder.encodeForJavascript,js)}}\">\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\nIf the type is css, then Encoder.encodeForCSS(value) is used.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n   <div class=\"{{escape( Encoder.encodeForCSS,css)}}\">\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\nIf helper\n\nIf helper does the same function, just like the regular 'if'. It checks the condition and returns accordingly. If the condition is true, the \"true case\" gets rendered and if the condition is false the \"false case\" gets rendered.\n\nSyntax : {{if(condition/testValue, trueCase, falseCase)}}\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n\t<div class=\"{{if(multiple,'multiple','single')}}\">\n\t\t<lyte-menu on-before-show=\"{{method('onBeforeShow')}}\"></lyte-menu>\n\t</div>\n</template>\n```\nIf equals\n\nThis helper function is used to check if two values are equal. It returns true if both the values are equal and it returns false if the values are not equal\n\nSyntax : {{ifEquals(value1, value2)}}\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n\t<div class=\"{{if(ifEquals(company,'zoho'),'own','others')}}\">\n\t\t<lyte-menu on-before-show=\"{{method('onBeforeShow')}}\"></lyte-menu>\n\t</div>\n</template>\n```\nIf not equals\n\nThis helper function is used to check if two values are unequal. This helper function returns true if both the values are not equal and if both the values are equal, it returns false.\n\nSyntax : {{ifNotEquals(value1, value2)}}\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n  <div class=\"{{if(ifNotEquals(company,'zoho'),'others','own')}}\">\n\t <lyte-menu on-before-show=\"{{method('onBeforeShow')}}\"></lyte-menu>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\nNegate\n\nIt works similarly to that of Logical Not operation. It reverses the logical value of a boolean expression or value, thereby helping to negate the value. It returns either a true or false value.\n\nSyntax : {{negate(valueToNegate)}}\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n  <div class={{if(invert,negate(someValue),someValue)}}>\n\t<lyte-menu on-before-show=\"{{method('onBeforeShow')}}\"></lyte-menu>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\nConcat\n\nThis helper function is used to concat two or more values. You can use this concat function with the following syntax,\n\nSyntax : {{concat(value1,value2,...valueN)}}\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n  <div class=\"{{if(full,concat(firstName,'-',lastName),lastName)}}\">\n\t<lyte-menu on-before-show=\"{{method('onBeforeShow')}}\"></lyte-menu>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\nLog\n\nThis helper class supports the logging function from the templates. With this helper class, you can log anything to the console.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n   {{log(\"user Name :\" , name)}}\n\t<lyte-menu on-before-show=\"{{method('onBeforeShow')}}\">\n\t</lyte-menu>\n</template>\n```\nDebugger\n\nThis helper function is used to provide debugging facility from the templates.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n  {{debugger()}}\n\t<lyte-menu on-before-show=\"{{method('onBeforeShow')}}\"></lyte-menu>\n</template>\n```\nLbind\n\nThis helper function is used to support DOM for any changes in the data.\n\n(i) In cases of input form elements, you might need to bind the input value to a variable in the component (DOM to data). In those cases, you can use 'lbind' helper to bind DOM to component data.\n\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" value=\"{{lbind(a.b)}}\"/>\n```\n\nWhenever the value of the input field changes, the same gets reflected in variable \"a.b\" of the component\n\nNote: For the checkbox, it will be a checked attribute instead of the value attribute. For other input types such as textarea and select, it would still be the 'value' attribute on which we use the 'lbind' helper.\n\n```html\n<input type=\"checkbox\" checked=\"{{lbind(a.b)}}\"/>\n```\n```html\n<textarea value=\"{{lbind(a.b)}}\"></textarea>\n```\n```html\n<select value=\"{{lbind(a.b)}}\"></select>\n```\n\n(ii) In cases of parent-child components, when we need changes to be reflected in the parent component when the change has occurred in the child, we can use 'lbind' to bind the child component data to the parent component.\n\n```html\n<test-component2 message=\"{{lbind(hello)}}\"></test-component2>\n```\n\nHere when the \"message\" property of the child component (test-component2) changes, the value of the \"hello\" property of the parent component (test-component1) also changes.\n\nCustom Helpers\n\nApart from the default helpers, you can also register any helper of your choice. This can be done by using the following command in the terminal.\n\nlyte generate helper helperName\n\nYou can find the helpers inside the components just like the below image.\n\nLet us consider an example where isArray is defined as a custom helper.\n\n```html\n<div lyte-if=\"{{isArray(serverData)}}\">\n\t<div> this is array data type</div>\n<div>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Helper } from \"@slyte/component\";\nHelper.register(\"isArray\", function (item) {\nif (Array.isArray() && item instanceof Array) {\n\treturn true;\n }\nreturn false;\n});\n```\nImporting Custom Helpers\n\nBy default, the framework bundles the helper function written in the template file. But if the helper is not written in the template file, you can import the helper with lyte-import and get it bundled.\n\n```html\n<lyte-import>\n    <import-helper name=\"binding-check-helpers\"></import-helper>\n</lyte-import>\n```\nExecution order of the helpers\nIn older version\n\nThe helpers can be combined with 'And' operator and executed. Let us consider a scenario.\n\n```html\n<div>\n{{helper1() && helper2()}}\n</div>\n```\n\nHere, let us consider, helper1() returns false and the helper2() returns true. In the previous versions, the helper1() will be executed and then the helper2() will be exected. Only after the execution, the 'And' operation is performed which would return false based on the given scenario.\n\nIn newer version\n\nIn the newer version, if the helper1() return false, the helper2() will not be executed. By default, on performing 'And' operation if one returns false then the result would be false.\n\nRecommended suggestion for older versions\n\nIf you are using the older version, set the flag 'lyteSequence' as true. Have a look at the below code snippet to see how it works. You can add the code snippet in the registry or in app.js.\n\nFrom\n\n1.0.2\n\n```html\nclass CrmComponentRegistry extends ComponentRegistry\n{\n\tstatic lyteSequence = true;\n}\n```\n```html\nclass crmapp extends lyte\n{\n  static lyteSequence = true;\n}\n```\n```html\n<select value=\"{{lbind(a.b)}}\"></select>\n```\n\nLet's navigate to learn about action handling.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Action Handling\n\nIn this section you shall get to know about handling and how an event gets bubbled up from the child component to the parent component.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn general, actions are the mechanism for wiring UI events (like clicks, input changes, and menu closes) to component logic. They let you keep your templates declarative while still responding to user interactions. The events can be catagorised as DOM event handling and Custom event handling.\n\nThe prime difference in DOM event handling and Custom Event handling is that\n\nFor native HTML elements (like <span>), sLyte uses the standard DOM event attributes, such as onclick, onchange, oninput, etc. These are not hyphenated because they match how the browser expects event attributes to be named.\nAnd if the user wishes to throw any custom events other than the DOM events, the framework uses custom event binding with hyphenated names, such as on-close, on-select, etc. These are not native DOM events, they are the custom events of the components.\n\nNote: The framework to differentiate a custom event to a DOM event, it uses 'on-' prefixed with a descriptive event name to make it clear that this is a custom event.\n\nDOM events handling\n\nAs discussed above, for native HTML elements (like <span>), sLyte uses the standard DOM event attributes, such as onclick, onchange, oninput, etc. These are not hyphenated because they match how the browser expects event attributes to be named.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n   <span> {{title}} </span>\n   <span onclick=\"{{action('editBlog')}}\"> Edit </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      title : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog title\" })\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      editBlog : function{\n             console.log(\"Hello world\");\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\nPassing event as argument\n\nYou can pass the native event object(event) and the component instance (this) to an action in the template file just like the below code snippet\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n   <button onclick=\"{{action('handleClick',event,this)}}\"> Edit </button>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      handleClick(event, compRef)  : function{\n            console.log(\"The Event object is:\", event);  // native click event\n            console.log(\"The Component instance is:\", compRef);   // this component instance\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\n\nIt is to be noted that the 'event' attribute always refers to the DOM event object (e.g., MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent, etc.). and 'this' refers to the current component instance, so you can access the properties and methods on it.\n\nPassing the component data as arguments\n\nYou can pass the data from the component as arguments just like the below code snippet.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n   <button onclick=\"{{action('handleClick',id,title,content)}}\"> Edit </button>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n       id : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"1233\" }),\n       title : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog title\" }),\n       content : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \" A massive earthquake hit US\" })\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n            handleClick  : function(blogId ,blogTitle, blogContent ){\n            alert( \"Blog:\" + blogId +\"and the title is\" + blogTitle + \"With content\" + blogContent + \"is Edited.\" );\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\n\nHere the data 'id','title' and 'content' is passed from the component.\n\nPreventing event bubbling\n\nNote: In general, events bubbling happens within related components(Child -> Parent). It is also possible to pass the events across the non-related components with Global events.\n\nHave a look at the below code snippet to see, how the event propogation is prevented.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n   <span> {{title}} </span>\n   <span onclick=\"{{action('editBlog',id, content,event,this)}}\"> Edit </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"1233\" }),\n      title : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog title\" }),\n      content : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \" A massive earthquake hit US\" })\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      editBlog : function( blogId , blogContent , event , target ){\n      console.log( event );    // Event Object\n      console.log( target );   // target element\n      alert( \"Blog:\" + blogId + \"With content\" + blogContent + \"is Edited.\" );\n      return false;            // Will stop event bubbling.\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\n\nIn general, event bubbling happens from the child to the parent component. To stop the event bubbling in the above code snippet, the action 'edit-blog' is made to return false.\n\nCustom events handling\n\nCustom events help you to carry out any functionality of your choice to the custom elements. Custom events are usually defined with a hyphen in it. For example, onClose is defined as on-close. While using in a template the camel case must be represented as hyphen values.\n\nCustom events should contain at least one hyphen(-) in the name say, onClose is valid (whereas close is not valid). While using in a template the camel case will be represented as hyphen values. Say onClose will be used as on-close\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n   <span> {{title}} </span>\n   <span onclick=\"{{action('editBlog',id, content)}}\"> Edit </span>\n   <span> {{content}} </span>\n   <menu-bar on-close=\"{{action('onMenuClose')}}\"> </menu-bar>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"1233\" }),\n      title : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog title\" }),\n      content : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog Content\" })\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      onMenuClose : function(){\n        return false; // will stop onClose event bubbling\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\n```javascript\n<template tag-name=\"menu-bar\">\n   <ul>\n     <template lyte-for=\"{{menuItems}} as menuItem index\">\n         <li onclick=\"{{action(\"closeMenu\")}}\"> {{menuItem}} </li>\n     </template>\n   </ul>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass MenuBar extends Component {\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      closeMenu : function() {\n        this.throwEvent( \"on-close\" ); // Throws onClose event\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {MenuBar};\n```\n\nLet's check how to throw a custom event (onClose) is thrown from menu-bar (childcomponent) to the parent component(blogPost).\n\nIn the above code snippet, on clicking the <li> element, the closeMenu action gets triggered. Inside the closeMenu, 'this.throwEvent' propogates the method 'on-close' to the parent(blog-post) component. And so the method 'onMenuClose' in the parent componet(blog-post) gets triggered. You can learn more about this.throwEvent here.\n\nOn using this.throwEvent and if false is returned in action, the propogation stops.\n\nIt is not mandated to explicitly specify listeners for custom events. If the parent contains onClose action and if the event is not stopped explicitly the same gets invoked.\n\n\n\nComponent - Router Action Handling\n\nAs shown above, the event bubbles from the child to all its parents. While using with lyte-router the custom events also pass through Slyte-routes.\n\nFor example: A route say route1 renders component tc-1 and a sub-route route2 (route1/route2) renders tc-2 , and another nested route route3 (route1/route2/route3) renders tc-3, which contains sub components tc-4 and tc-5. Now a close event is thrown from tc-5. The event bubbles as shown in the below diagram:\n\nThe event bubbles from tc-5 -> tc-4 -> tc3 -> route3 -> tc2 -> route2 -> tc1 -> route1.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Global Events\n\nGlobal events are used to handle events between unrelated components and across the application(widgets). Let us consider an example where you need to notify a call creation to other widgets. You can do it with global events. It follows the pub-sub(publish-subscribe) pattern, where an n number of subscribers can listen to an event and react to the same.\n\nAdd Event Listener\n\nYou can add the listeners in two ways.\n\nMethod 1\n\nYou can add listeners to an event using the addEventListener function in app instance scope or addon instance scope. This function returns a unique listenerId, which can be used to remove the subscribed listener from the app or addon instance scope.\n\n```javascript\nvar listenerId = this.$app.addEventListener( \"callCreated\" , function(){\n   // Handles call creation\n });\n var listenerId2 = this.$addon.addEventListener( \"callCreated\" , function(){\n  // Handles call creation\n});\n```\n\nYou can add listeners to an event using the addEventListener app scope. This function returns a unique listenerId, which can be used to remove the subscribed listener from the app or addon instance scope.\n\n```javascript\nimport { TestApp } from \"../app.js\"\nimport { TestAddon } from \"../addon.js\"\n  var listenerId = TestApp.addEventListener( \"callCreated\" , function(){\n    // Handles call creation\n  });\n  var listenerId2 = TestAddon.addEventListener( \"callCreated\" , function(){\n  // Handles call creation\n});\n```\n\nMethod 2\n\nYou can also add listeners in the template using lyte-event-listener element. The element takes two attributes, event-name and on-fire.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n   <button onclick={{action('perform')}}>Submit</button>\n   <lyte-event-listener event-name=\"callCreated\" on-fire=\"{{ action('handleCallCreation')}}\"/>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass TestComponent extends Component {\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      handleCallCreation : function(){\n        alert(\"hello,how are you\");\n      },\n      perform: function () {\n        this.$app.triggerEvent(\"callCreated\");\n      }\n      }\n    }\n  }\nexport {TestComponent};\n```\n\nWhen the callCreated event is triggered, the Component invokes handleCallCreation function.\n\nNote: Listeners added in the template will be removed once the DOM node is removed from the document\n\n\n\nTrigger Event\n\nThe triggerEvent function can be used to trigger a registered event in the app instance or addon instance scope. It takes the event name, followed by the arguments to be passed to the listener function in the app instance or addon instance scope\n\n```javascript\nthis.$app.triggerEvent( \"callCreated\" , {\n  \"id\" : 12334,\n  \"name\" : \"CustomerCall\"\n});\nthis.$addon.triggerEvent( \"callCreated\" , {\n  \"id\" : 12334,\n  \"name\" : \"CustomerCall\"\n});\n```\n\nThe triggerEvent function can be used to trigger a registered event in the app class or addon class scope. It takes the event name, followed by the arguments to be passed to the listener function in the app class or addon class scope\n\n```javascript\nimport { TestApp } from \"../app.js\";\nimport { TestAddon } from \"../addon.js\";\nTestApp.triggerEvent( \"callCreated\" , {\n  \"id\" : 12334,\n  \"name\" : \"CustomerCall\"\n});\nTestAddon.triggerEvent( \"callCreated\" , {\n  \"id\" : 12334,\n  \"name\" : \"CustomerCall\"\n});\n```\nRemove Event Listener\n\nThe subscribed event can be removed using the removeEventListener function in the app instance or addon instance scope, it takes the listenerId as the argument.\n\n```javascript\nthis.$app.removeEventListener( listenerId );\nthis.$addon.removeEventListener( listenerId );\n```\n\nThe subscribed event can be removed using the removeEventListener function in the app class or addon class scope, it takes the listenerId as the argument.\n\n```javascript\nimport { TestApp } from \"../app.js\";\nimport { TestAddon } from \"../addon.js\";\nTestApp.removeEventListener( listenerId );\nTestAddon.removeEventListener( listenerId );\n```\n\nLet's navigate to learn about life cycle hook..\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Custom Directives\nIntroduction\n\nDirectives are used to create your own custom Attribute Directives for any desired functionality and styling of element as desired. sLyte provides callback during various stages of the element like before-append, on-append, after-append ,before-remove, on-remove, after-remove. So whenever the element is removed or appended on the DOM using framework, the respective callbacks will be triggered. To specify a custom directive , you need to start the attribute name with \"@\" followed by attribute value which will be passed as argument to callbacks.\n\nDirective can be created with CLI command\nlyte generate directive directiveName\nAnd the file gets generated at the path \"\\components\\directives\\directiveName\".\n\nExample\n```javascript\nimport { Directive } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass Fade extends Directive {\n\tbeforeAppend({node,dependentPromises,initial,state}){\n\t\tconsole.log(\"beforeappend\",node)\n\t\tnode.setAttribute('class','fade2');\n\t}\n\tonAppend({node,dependentPromises,initial,state}){\n\t\tconsole.log(\"onappend\",node)\n\t\tvar timeoutId = setTimeout(function(){\n\t\t\tnode.classList.add('in')\n\t\t\tclearTimeout(timeoutId);\n\t\t}.bind(node), 2000);\n\t}\n\tafterAppend({node,dependentPromises,initial,state}){\n\t\tconsole.log(\"afterAppend\",node)\n\t}\n\tbeforeRemove({node,childPromise,previousSiblingPromise,state}){\n\t\tlet node = event.node;\n\t\tconsole.log(\"beforeRemove\",node)\n\t}\n\tonRemove({node,childPromise,previousSiblingPromise,done,state}){\n\t\tvar ev = event;\n\t\tvar node = ev.node;\n\t\tnode.setAttribute('class','fade5s away');\n\t\tvar timeoutId = setTimeout(function(){\n\t\t\tclearTimeout(timeoutId);\n\t\t\tdone();\n\t\t},2000)\n\t}\n\tafterRemove({node,childPromise,previousSiblingPromise,state}){\n\t\tlet node = event.node;\n\t\tconsole.log(\"afterRemove\",node)\n\t}\n}\nexport {Fade};\n```\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"welcome-comp\">\n\t<span @fade> fading content </span>\n</template>\n```\n\nSo whenever the element is appended or removed from the DOM , the respective callbacks gets called.\n\nDirective Hooks\nbeforeAppend\n\nThis is called before appending the directive element to the DOM.\n\nonAppend\n\nThis is called immediately after appending the directive element on the dom.\n\nafterAppend\n\nThis is called after appending the directive element on the DOM and after all other's onAppend hooks execution.\n\nbeforeRemove\n\nThis hook can be used before removing the element from the DOM.\n\nonRemove\n\nThis is called before removing the element from the DOM and promise will be passed as argument. Only after resolving the promise the element will get removed from DOM (if resolving takes time more than 5secs or resolve is not called, then sLyte will resolve it by default)\n\nafterRemove\n\nThis hook can be called after removing the element from DOM.\n\nPromises\n\nPromises are provided for the element removal to achieve transition and animations through it. So while resolving promise, \"on-before\" hook will trigger node removal and then \"after-remove\" hook will be called . When there is nested and sibling directives those promise will be passed as argument in order to hold and resolve promises based on user requirement. Parent directive node removal will never wait for child directives promise for removing node so user must handle with childPromises whether to wait or resolve earlier.\n\nArguments\n\nCustom attribute's value is passed as argument for callbacks , the argument value can be string or dynamic data or helper value. In the below example, a directive is configured to a span node which is passed with static and dynamic arguments which will be invoked from \"this.config\" when the hooks executed.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"welcome-comp\">\n\t<span @fade=1000> fading content </span>\n\t<span @fade={{dynamicValue}}> fading content </span>\n\t<span @fade={{helperValue()}}> fading content </span>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Directive } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass Fade extends Directive {\n\tbeforeAppend({node,dependentPromises,initial,state}){\n\t\tconsole.log(\"beforeappend\",node,this.config)\n\t\tnode.setAttribute('class','fade2');\n\t}\n\tonAppend({node,dependentPromises,initial,state}){\n\t\tconsole.log(\"onappend\",node)\n\t\tvar timeoutId = setTimeout(function(){\n\t\t\tnode.classList.add('in')\n\t\t\tclearTimeout(timeoutId);\n\t\t}.bind(node), this.config);\n\t}\n\tafterAppend({node,dependentPromises,initial,state}){\n\t\tconsole.log(\"afterAppend\",node,this.config)\n\t}\n\tbeforeRemove({node,childPromise,previousSiblingPromise,state}){\n\t\tconsole.log(\"beforeRemove\",node,this.config)\n\t}\n\tonRemove({node,childPromise,previousSiblingPromise,done,state}){\n\t\tnode.setAttribute('class','fade5s away');\n\t\tvar timeoutId = setTimeout(function(){\n\t\t\tclearTimeout(timeoutId);\n\t\t\tdone();\n\t\t},this.config)\n\t}\n\tafterRemove({node,childPromise,previousSiblingPromise,state}){\n\t\tconsole.log(\"afterRemove\",node,this.config)\n\t}\n}\nexport {Fade};\n```\nParams\n\nParams in the hook methods will contain several informations as follows.\n\nstate :\nreturns the state of the node\nnode :\nreturns the directive element\ninitial :\nreturns true whenever a component is newly rendered in DOM for the first time.\ndependentPromises :\nOn toggling an'if check' the list of removing directives promises are passed to appending callbacks.\nchildPromise :\nIf a directive is added to a node which might have childnodes with other directive attributes, On toggling the parent dynamic content, the promises of the child content will be returned as array of direct childPromise (child's child promise will not be available).\npreviousSiblingPromise :\nIf a directive is added to a node which might have childnodes with other directive attributes, On toggling the parent dynamic content, the callback will be called for every directive node. In that case, the promise of previously removing directive will be returned here.\nHooks order\n\nThe order in which the hooks are called is explained with an example below.\n\nExample\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"welcome-comp\">\n\t<div lyte-if=\"{{truedata}}\">\n\t\t<div id=\"red\" @\"my-transition-red\" = \"500\">\n\t\t  promise resolved in

    "order": 17,
    "content": "Shadow DOM\n\nAn important aspect of web components is encapsulation — being able to keep the markup structure, style, and behavior hidden and separate from other code on the page. This is acheived with Shadow DOM. Shadow DOM also helps to keep the code clean and nice.\n\nsLyte shadow\n\nYou have the fullest ability to define a component with Shadow DOM through directives. Have a look at the below code snippet to see how it is done.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"welcome-comp\">\n\t<user-comp @shadow> </user-comp>\n\t<user-comp @shadow={{value}}> </user-comp>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass WelcomeComp extends Component {\n\tdata() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tvalue : prop(\"boolean\")\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport {WelcomeComp};\n```\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-comp\" @shadow-supported>\n\t<div> content inside shadow DOM</div>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\n\tdata() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tvalue : prop(\"boolean\")\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport {UserComp};\n```\n\nThe component (user-comp) to which the shadow is being applied, should allow the shadow implementation by adding \"@shadow-supported\" attribute in the template tag of its html file (user-comp.html).\n\ndirectiveName - \"@shadow\"\ndataType - boolean\ntrue data - applies shadow DOM and scope its style inside it\nfalse/undefined data - dont applies any shadowDOM and its style will be applied in document.head\n\nMaking a component as shadow component, can be achieved through instance's directive attribute. We can also pass dynamic value as argument to the shadow directive. You can check if the component has used Shadow DOM, only in the didconnect callback of sLyte. This is because it gets applied to a component only after init callback. The components inside shadow component, may or may not be shadow component, depending on its \"@shadow\" directive attributes. Suppose if the child component is a non shadow component, then its style will be appended on its shadow parent component (whereas the style will be applied to entire shadow boundary).\n\n\nStyle handling\n\nIn V3, usually the component styles will be appended to the head during component registration, but the framework knows whether the component is shadow or not in instance level, so based on lyte shadow data, the style will be either appended on head or will be appended inside the shadow component.\n\nIf a non shadow component comes inside a shadow component then its style will be inside its shadow parent's component.\n\nIf repeated nonshadow component comes inside shadow component, then multiple style will not be appended in parent shadow component. Rather only one time the style of repeated nonshadow component will be appended.\n\nIf multiple non shadow component comes inside non shadow component without any parent shadow component, then non shadow component's style will be appended only onetime on the head of the document.\n\nsLyte shadow style\n\nThere is a provision for shadow component where we can pass their style to shadow DOM as @shadow-style=\"css\" from attribute or data where the framework will create style tag and append it inside shadow component.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"welcome-comp\" >\n\t<user-comp @shadow=true @shadow-style=\"p{color:red}\"> </user-comp>\n</template>\n```\n```html\n<welcome-comp >\n\t<user-comp>\n\t  <style>\n\t   p {color : red}\n\t  <div> content </div>\n\t</user-comp>\n</welcome-comp>\n```\n\ndirectiveName - \"@shadow-style\"\ndataType - string\ndesc - creates style tag with passed content and append it inside a shadow component\n\nYield handling\n\nWhen a yield content is inserted in a shadow component, then the lyte-yield will be placed as a shadow component along with its yield styles (style of the component, where the template is=\"registeryield\" is present).\n\nThere is a provision for lyte yield shadow component where they can pass their style to shadow DOM as @shadow-style=\"css\" using attribute or data. Consider the following example.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"shadow-yield1\">\n\t<shadow-yield2 @shadow=true>\n\t\t<template is=\"yield\" yield-name=\"name\">\n\t\t\t<p id=\"sd22\"class=\"sd1\">this is header1</p>\n\t\t\t<p>this is header2</p>\n\t\t</template>\n\t</shadow-yield2>\n</template>\n```\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"shadow-yield2\">\n\t<div> shadow-yield2 content</div>\n\t<lyte-yield yield-name=\"name\" @shadow-style=\"p{color:red}\">\n\t</lyte-yield>\n</template>\n```\n```html\n<shadow-yield1>\n\t<shadow-yield2 @shadow=true>\n\t\t// shadow\n\t\t\t<div> shadow-yield2 content</div>\n\t\t\t<lyte-yield yield-name=\"sd3\" @shadow-style=\"p{color:red}\">\n\t\t\t\t// shadow\n\t\t\t\t<style> // style of shadow-yield1 </style>\n\t\t\t\t<style> p{color:red} </style>\n\t\t\t\t<p id=\"sd22\"class=\"sd1\">this is header1</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>this is header2</p>\n\t\t\t</lyte-yield>\n\t</shadow-yield2>\n</shadow-yield1>\n```\nAccess shadow\n\nThe content of a shadow component can't be queryselected directly, instead you need to queryselect the shadow component and then access its shadowRoot using element.shadowRoot and then queryselect the required element. For Example: document.querySelector(\"welcome-comp\").shadowRoot.querySelector(\"welcome-child-comp\") So this will return the welcome-child-comp element. If we need the host element then do \"element.getRootNode()\" , which will return its parent shadowRoot and then you can access the component tag using \"shadowRoot.host\".\n\nBest practices\n\nApplying shadow DOM for nested micro level components, like lyte-button, lyte-text is not recommended.\n\nShadow DOM must be used for widget like components (Scoping for bunch of components together as a substitute for iframe)\n\nWhen an external script, library or extension are used to parse lyte shadow content then we have to make sure it supports shadow content. There are many 3rd party libraries (or extensions) that won't work with Shadow DOM content because they were not designed to deal with it, or need some additional configuration to work with Shadow DOM.\n\nLet's navigate to learn about Server side rendering.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data. We do have a host of other libraries, tools and extensions which ease the app development making it faster to build apps using sLyte.\n\nGit RepoRelease Notes Forum"

    "order": 18,
    "content": "Viewport\nWhat is a viewport\n\nViewport rendering is a process where the framework will render the actual content only when the content came in to the view port (display). Assume we are rendering huge number of heavy components at once which may takes some time. sLyte allows you to make use of the view port activation of components, so user can define a placeholder content and actual content in the component. Onscrolling, the view will update the placeholder content and will render the actual content. Viewport can be implemented in two ways, Viewport can be applied to entire component or Viewport can be applied to set of html contents inside a component.\n\nNote:\n\nViewport will work based on browser's getBoundRectClient and so placeholder content should have the same height and width of the actual content.\n\nviewport for elements\n\nViewport can be implemented to set of elements using @view-in directive. To the actual content of the element inside the component's html file as shown in example, add @view-in and to the loading content, add @view-out. By default, if no configs are provided, the viewport will be enabled for those elements. If we want to disable viewPort for the elements based on some condition , then we can pass the boolean value. These boolean value will be considered as a flag for disabling it. On passing true, the viewport gets disabled.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"welcome-comp\"></template>\n  <lyte-table lt-prop-yield = true>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'yield'>\n      <lyte-table-structure>\n        <lyte-thead>\n          <lyte-tr>\n            <template lyte-for=\"{{headerJSON}} as list,indexVal\" >\n              <lyte-th>{{list.name}} </lyte-th>\n            </template>\n          </lyte-tr>\n        </lyte-thead>\n        <lyte-tbody>\n          <template lyte-for=\"{{contentJSON}} as list,indexVal\" >\n              <lyte-tr @view-in style=\"width: 1554.91px; height: 48.1818px;\">\n              <!-- actual content , assuming \"lyte-td\" as heavy component -->\n                <template lyte-for=\"{{headerJSON}} as header,indexVal\" >\n                  <lyte-td>\n                      {{list[header.body]}}\n                  </lyte-td>\n                </template>\n              </lyte-tr>\n              <lyte-tr @view-out>\n              <!-- loading content or place holder content -->\n                <template lyte-for=\"{{headerJSON}} as header,indexVal\" >\n                  <lyte-td style=\"padding: 5px;\">\n                    <div style=\"background-color: #f7f7f7; height: 25px;\"></div>\n                  </lyte-td>\n                </template>\n              </lyte-tr>\n            </template>\n        </lyte-tbody>\n      </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n  </lyte-table>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"slyte/component\";\nclass WelcomeComp extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return return {\n      headerJSON : prop ( 'array' , { default : [\n        { name : 'No' , body : 'serial' },\n        { name : 'Place' , body : 'place' }, // 'name' is headerLabelKey and 'body' is bodyLabelKey\n        { name : 'Famous' , body : 'name' },\n        { name : 'Architecture' , body : 'Architecture' },\n        { name : 'King' , body : 'King' }\n      ] } ),\n      contentJSON : prop ( 'array' , { default : [{\n        name: \"Taj mahal\",\n        serial: '1',\n        place: 'Agra',\n        id: '17',\n        class: '1648',\n        Architecture: 'Mughal',\n        King: 'Shajahan',\n        Dyansty: 'Moghul'\n        }, {\n        name: \"Mysore palace\",\n        serial: '2',\n        place: 'Mysore',\n        id: '20',\n        class: '1912',\n        Architecture: 'Indo-Saracenic Revival ',\n        King: 'Krishnaraja udaiyar',\n        Dyansty: 'Wadiyar'\n        }, {\n        name: \"Brihadheeswara temple\",\n        serial: '3',\n        place: 'Tanjore',\n        id: '11',\n        class: '1010',\n        Architecture: 'dravidian',\n        King: 'Raja raja chola',\n        Dyansty: 'Chozha'\n        }, {\n        name: \"Hawa mahal\",\n        serial: '4',\n        place: 'Jaipur',\n        id: '18',\n        class: '1799',\n        Architecture: 'Rajput -

    "content": "Form handling\nCreating a component\n\nLet's take a look at an example of how to handle a simple form submission using components. Initially, you need to create a component named \"create-user\", which will encapsulate the creation of \"user\".\n\n```html\n<form>\n   First name:\n   <input type=\"text\" name=\"firstname\" value=\"{{lbind(firstName)}}\">\n   Last name:\n   <input type=\"text\" name=\"lastname\" value=\"{{lbind(lastName)}}\">\n   User Id:\n   <input type=\"text\" name=\"userId\" value=\"{{lbind(userId)}}\">\n   <button onclick={{action('submit',event)}}> Submit </button>\n</form>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass CreateUser extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      firstName : prop( \"string\" ),\n      lastName : prop( \"string\" ),\n      userId : prop( \"number\" )\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    submit : function(event) {\n      var users = this.getData(\"user\");\n      if(Object.keys(this.getData(\"errors\") === 0)){\n        // send a post request to save the user\n      }\n      event.preventDefault();\n      event.stopPropagation();\n    }\n  }\n  static methods() {\n    return {\n      // Functions which can be used as callback in the component.\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {CreateUser};\n```\n\nIn the above example, you have used lbind for binding the input value to the respective data (firstName, lastName and userId ). So the value in the input fields will be in sync with the data of the component.\n\nHandling Errors\n\nNow try adding some error handling function to the form. The userId, is provided as type \"number\" and hence the value entered in the input must be a numerical value. If not, an error message must be displayed\n\n```html\nUser Id:\n<input type=\"text\" name=\"userId\" value=\"{{lbind(userId)}}\">\n<template lyte-if=\"{{errors.userId}}\">\n   <span> userId is not valid. Please check. </span>\n</template>\n```\n\nOn entering a value other than a number in the userId field, error will be set in the \"errors\" object of the component. You can use the errors object in the template to know if the error has been set or not.\n\nHandling Submit\n\nNow, it is time to handle the form submission. In most cases, you would be handling form submission by first validating the object to be sent and subsequently sending a request to the server. In this case, you can handle the same in the \"submit\" action of the component.\n\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n  submit : function(event){\n    var users = this.getData(\"user\");\n    if(Object.keys(this.getData(\"errors\") === 0)){\n    // send a post request to save the user\n    }\n    event.preventDefault();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe above code checks, if the errors object of the component is empty. After which you can send the request to the server for saving the created user. Note that \"preventDefault\" method of event object is used to prevent the form from submitting.\n\nLet's navigate to learn about raw components.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "ROUTER\nIntroduction\n\nA clean, well-structured web app always has a structured route. But this property is often overlooked. To make your web application stand out, sLyte has brought up the Router layer.\n\nWhat is a router layer?\n\nWell, the router layer is responsible for maintaining the navigation across different pages and views of the application. It intercepts any change in the URL and helps in rendering the corresponding view.\n\nIn an application, the navigation occurs in the following scenario:\n\nOn receiving a URL in the address bar(Initial load)\nWhen the user clicks on the hyperlink provided on any webpage or web application.\nWhen the user generates any actionable events which invoke a change in URL (Javascript triggered URL change)\n\nBefore diving into how sLyte handles these navigation, let's see how modularity in the router layer works.\n\nEach page or a view in the applications is to be visualized as a set of routes (segments), with each Route taking care of a particular part of the view while data loading. This segregation or modularisation helps in managing resource downloads needed at each route, along with proper code maintenance and greater control of things when navigating from one sub-view of the application to another sub-view.\n\nAs the unwanted downloads and the unwanted rendering gets eliminated, the initial load of the application gets speeded up.\n\nAnd now back to how the navigation is being handled, sLyte tries to map the URL in the browser to a set of routes with the help of the map(router/maps/map.js) created in the router which will host the mapping between the routes and their corresponding URLs.\n\nSo, a single URL gets mapped to one or more routes, and each Route is then executed to construct the entire page or view.\n\nWhenever any subsequent change in the URL occurs, sLyte creates a difference between the current URL with the previous URL and then makes sure that only the changed part of the URL (Route) gets executed and the corresponding changes are being done on the page. This ensures that you don't make unnecessary re-rendering when nothing in the parent part of the view (Route) has been changed.\n\nIt provides means, by which you can perform navigation from HTML as well as from JS perspective by using appropriate HTML Tags and JS functions, so that the navigation can be handled smoothly across the application.\n\nIt helps the developers to visualize a page or a view as different routes or segments and helps in building each segment. By doing this, it maintains a clear segregation of resources (components), behavior, and data required by each segment, ultimately speeding up the first paint of the application on initial load. More on this later!!!\n\nThe Router layer takes care of all these and a lot more. It provides you with a whole lot of callbacks and functions and incorporates a lot of best practices out of the box. A proper design of a web app starts from designing your router properly. And the router takes care of it.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data. We do have a host of other libraries, tools and extensions which ease the app development making it faster to build apps using sLyte.\n\nGit RepoRelease Notes Forum"

    "order": 21,
    "content": "THE ROUTER\nIntroduction\n\nThe \"Router\" file is the core of sLyte Router. It is where you provide the mapping between your application and browser URL. The entire design of your web app with respect to state maintenance in URL relies on this. Apart from mapping, it also provides you with options for configuring your router. You can find the router file in router/router.js. This is how it looks likes:\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppMap } from \"./maps/map\";\nclass AppRouter extends Router {\n  lookups(){\n      return [];\n  }\n  getConfig() {\n    return {\n      baseURL : '',\n      history : \"html5\"\n      baseMap : AppMap\n    };\n  }\n  beforeRouteNavigation(prevNav, currentNav, historyObj) {\n  }\n  afterRouteNavigation(currentNav) {\n  }\n}\nexport default AppRouter;\n```\nInstantiating a Router\n\nInstance for the Router is created automatically while creating an app in sLyte.\n\n```javascript\nimport {Lyte} from \"@slyte/core/src/lyte\";\nimport {AppRouter} from \"router/app-router\";\nclass App extends Lyte {\n  lookups() {\n    return [{router : AppRouter}];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWhen the above App gets instantiated, AppRouter will be instantiated as a service and injected into the app and you can find it in app.js.\n\nHistory\n\nBefore diving further, let us have a look at different types of history. Knowing the history shapes your product better.\n\nHash history\nHTML5 history\n\nLet us now see an example\n\nHTML5 History - https://abc.com/org/users/1\n\nHash History - https://abc.com/org#users/1\n\nOn viewing it, you can clearly figure out, that hash history differs from HTML5 history. The hash history uses the hash symbol in the URL to set and read location.\n\nThe difference doesn't stop there. There are a few other things that you may need to consider before you conclude on which history to use for your web app.\n\nWhen you hit the above-mentioned hash history URL in the browser, the request URL would be only until before the \"#\" (https://abc.com/org). It will not send the entire URL to the server. So in cases where your server requires the full URL, it is advisable to use HTML5 history.\n\nBut in cases where your web app is like a SPA, wherein you need to return a single HTML irrespective of your URL, hash history makes it easier, since you only need to configure a single URL mapping on your server-side instead of defining all the URL's.\n\nSo which history to go for, relies completely on your app's use case. With sLyte, support is guaranteed for both types.\n\nThe default one is the \"hash\" history. You can, however, override the defaults as shown below. You can change it in router.js\n\n```javascript\ngetConfig() {\n  return {\n    history : \"html5\"\n  }\n}\n```\nBase URL\n\nConsider a case where your application has a constant base path that needs to be appended to all your URLs. In such scenario's, configuring the base URL makes your job easy.\n\nFor example,\n\nhttp://abc.com/org/users/list\n\nhttp://abc.com/org/settings\n\nIn the above case, \"org\" is the base URL that needs to be added to all the URL's in the application. The Router allows you to configure it in router.js\n\n```javascript\ngetConfig() {\n  return {\n    baseURL : '/org'\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBase URL is applicaple only for HTML5 history.\n\nRouter Map\n\nNext up to the most significant part of the router, the mappings. Here mapping of routes to the corresponding URL is done. A Route is an entity, which bundles the application logic that needs to be done whenever the mapped URL is accessed. You can find it in router/maps/map.js. As soon as you generate the route, it automatically gets mapped. Have a look at the below image to understand how a router map functons.\n\nWith the route being generated, the map.js makes the entry of the route. You can also hit it as a URL. You can find map.js in router/maps/map.js\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n      this.route(\"users\")\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nThat is it, you have mapped your first route in the router. Wait, where is the browser URL? sLyte by default maps the route \"users\" with the URL \"/users\". But if you want to have a different path name, then you need to specify your browser URL and you can do the same by having a look at the below code snippet\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n      this.route(\"users\",{path:'/orgUsers'})\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nIn the above code, the mapping of the route, \"users\" is done with the URL \"/orgUsers\" instead of the default \"/users\".\n\nGenerating additional map\n\nApart from the map.js file, you can also create additional map files. The command to generate an additional map file is:\n\nlyte generate map mapname\n\nYou can learn more about it here.\n\nIncluding the additional map\n\nThe created additional maps has to be clubbed with the parent map. And to do so you can use, this.include method. Here is an sample code for your reference.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport {UserMap} from \"./usermap\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n      this.route(\"users\",{path:'/orgUsers'})\n      this.include(UserMap);\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nIn the above code snippet,'UserMap' is the additional map file which is getting included to the parent map.\n\nWhile including the additional map file to the parent map, you need to import the additional map file.\n\nAdd maps dynamically\n\nYou can add maps dynamically with addMap api. You can leran more about it here.\n\nLazy route download\n\nThis involves in downloading only the route on demand based on the request URL. This plays a vital role in reducing the page load time.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n      this.lazyRoute(\"booknow\")\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nBy default, during the initial download, all routes gets download. But only on landing the 'booknow' page (as per the given example) the booknow route gets downloaded. This clearly states that a route mentioned 'this.lazyRoute' gets downloaded on demand.\n\nNested Routes\n\nPlanning to achieve modularisation in your app? Nested routes can do it. It also helps to organize your web apps in a structured manner. You can generate your nested route and define it like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n      this.route(\"users\",{path:'/orgUsers'}, () => {\n        this.route( \"list\" );\n      })\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nHere \"list\" route is nested under the \"users\" route. The nested route will take the URL \"/orgUsers/list\".\n\nHere is an example for you to have a look at how nested routes look. To create a route with the following structure router/routes/menu/submenu/subMenu1/user.js we use the command, lyte generate route menu.submenu.subMenu1.user Here, the route, 'user' is nested inside 'subMenu1' which again is nested inside 'subMenu' which again is nested inside 'menu'.\n\nDynamic params and wildcard handling\n\nDynamic params are used to handle the dynamic segments of a route's URL. Let's take the case of our \"users\" route. If you require to get the details of a particular user, the URL changes like this\n\nhttp://abc.com/orgUsers/2 - gives the detail page of the user with id \"2\"\n\nhttp://abc.com/orgUsers/1 - gives the detail page of the user with id \"1\"\n\nNow, the \"userId\" is a dynamic part that can take any value. You can handle such scenarios with dynamic params. Take a look at the below code, to see how dynamic params are handled.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n      this.route(\"users\",{path:'/orgUsers'}, () => {\n        this.route( \"list\" );\n        this.route( \"detail\" , { path : \"/:userId\" });\n      })\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nNow whenever the URL is \"orgUsers/1\" or \"orgUsers/2\", it gets mapped to the \"users.detail\" route, and the dynamic param would be \"1\" or \"2\" respectively.\n\nStraight to the point, just add ':' while mentioning the path, to initialize it as a dynamic param. Head to upcoming section to learn more about it.\n\nWildcard Handling :\n\nWildcard entries can be handled at any level of the route by using the wildcard entry symbol \"*\" in the route's path.\n\nHave a look at the below code snippet to see how it works.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n      this.route(\"users\",{path:'/orgUsers'}, () => {\n        this.route( \"list\" );\n        this.route( \"detail\" , { path : \"/:userId\" });\n      })\n      this.route( \"wildcard\" , { path : \"/*wildcard\" } ) ;\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nWildcard route will be called when none of the routes matches with the provided URL.\n\nYou can also specify wildcards at any level of nesting. The appropriate wildcard route will be called depending on the level of nesting.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n      this.route(\"users\",{path:'/orgUsers'}, () => {\n        this.route( \"list\" );\n        this.route( \"detail\" , { path : \"/:userId\" });\n      })\n      this.route( \"module\" , () => {\n        this.route( \"module-wildcard\" , { path : \"/*moduleWildcard\" });\n      });\n      this.route( \"wildcard\" , { path : \"/*wildcard\" } ) ;\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nFollowing is how the nested wildcards get called\n\n/module/wildcardString => module.module-wildcard\n\n/wildcardString => wildcard\n\nHowever, there can't be more than one wildcard at a particular level.\n\nRegex In Dynamic Param:\n\nLet us consider an example\n\n```javascript\nthis.route(\"module\",{ path : \":module\" , regex : /\\b(d1|d2|dp1|dp2|contacts|reports|leads)\\b/ })\n```\n\nHere, 'module' being the dynamic param gets passed, only if the regex condition is satisfied. If the regex condition fails, the route transists to wild card route if it is provided.\n\nIndex Route\n\nAn Index route is nothing but a route with \"/\" as the path name. One of the reasons that make this significant is that it gets executed by default whenever the base route is called. Consider the following example.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n    this.route( \"users\" , () => {\n      this.route( \"list\" );\n    })\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nHere, if you want to execute the \"list\" route by default whenever the URL \"users\" is hit, you can have the configuration as follows.\n\n```javascript\nthis.route( \"users\" , () => {\n  this.route( \"list\" , { \"path\" : \"/\" });\n});\n```\n\nBy this, \"/users\" will display the list of all users and you can easily switch to the detailed user page by having it as a parallel route.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n    this.route( \"users\" , () => {\n      this.route( \"list\" , { \"path\" : \"/\" });\n      this.route( \"detail\" , { \"path\" : \"/:userId\" });\n    });\n  }\n}\nexport default AppMap;\n```\n\nWhen navigation is made programatically (route API's/go-to),the index route should be mentioned.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "THE ROUTE\nIntroduction\n\nRoute deals with navigation handling. But how to create a route?.\n\nTo create a route, use the following command in the terminal\nlyte generate route <route_name> </route/path>\n\nLyte also allows you to create a nested route. You can create it with the following syntax\nlyte generate route <parent_route_name.child_route_name> </route/path>\n\nAfter creating a route, when a URL is hit, the router, maps the URL with the corresponding route. It will now invoke the routes, where you can handle the actions to be performed for that URL / route.\n\nWith route, you can perform a host of actions such as requirement fetch, data fetch, permissions check, view rendering and post rendering. It is mandatory to define route handler for each route by extending Route class. Have a look at the Skeleton of a route file:\n\n```javascript\nimport Route from \"@slyte/router.js\"\n\nclass Home extends Route {\n  static queryParams = [{\"per_page\" : { cache:false, reFetch :false }},\"page\"];\n  forceFetch() {} /*boolean or callback*/\n\n  renderLoadingTemplate(paramsObject) {\n    /* return where and what to render in loading state.(container and component/HTML) @param {Object} queryParams and dynamicParams  @return {Object} outlet and component/HTML */\n  }\n\n  beforeFetch(paramsObject) {\n    /* Pre processing stage where you can decide whether to abort/redirect the current navigation(e.g Permission check). */\n  }\n\n  fetch(paramsObject) {\n    /* Initiate data request that are necessary for the current page. */\n  }\n\n  afterFetch(Data, paramsObject) {\n    /* Manipulating data before returning data to component. */\n  }\n\n  divert(Data, paramsObject) {\n    /* Redirections based on data fetched. */\n  }\n\n  render(Data, paramsObject) {\n    /* return where and what to render.(container and component/HTML) */\n  }\n\n  afterRender(Data, paramsObject) {\n    /* Post processing of rendered page. */\n  }\n\n  beforeExit(Data, paramsObject) {\n    /* Will be invoked before a route is removed from view. */\n  }\n\n  didDestroy(Data, paramsObject) {\n    /* Will be invoked when a route is completly destroyed(remove residues of route. eg: file cache removal). */\n  }\n\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n\n      onBeforeLoad : function(paramsObject) {\n        /* Triggered once route navigation starts. */\n      }\n\n      onError : function(error, pausedTrans, paramsObject) {\n        /* Triggered by error on file load or on data request. */\n      }\n\n      willNavigate : function(navigation) {\n        /* Triggered before a navigation is going to change. */\n      }\n\n      didNavigate : function(paramsObject) {\n        /* Triggered after completion of navigation. */\n      }\n\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nexport { Home }\n```\nFunctions of Route\n\nThe route is responsible for\n\nRequirements fetch\nData fetch\nRendering the view\n\nHave a look at the below image to understand how a route comes into action.\n\nWhen the client sends a requirement fetch and data API request to the server, the server humbly receives it and provides the response to the client to render the view. The route plays a significant role in this client server interaction.\n\nRequirements Fetch\n\nMost of the frameworks out there are designed for SPA's in which the entire app is loaded as a single monolithic file during the first load. Despite options to split the entire application into logical applications, each logical app gets downloaded entirely, which is still heavy.\n\nsLyte is designed in such a way that, you can choose whether to have a single monolithic file for the entire app or to split the resource downloads up to individual route level. You can provide the resources to be downloaded for each and every route separately so that the initial load can be minimized and the files get downloaded only when that particular route is invoked (on-demand). This in turn makes your apps load fast.\n\nThere are three types of files which may be required for a route.\n\nResources : Component and CSS files gets downloaded parallelly with the API request (default). These files can be downloaded ondemand.\nDependencies : Store files gets downloaded as dependencies by default. Route file will execute only after downloading these files.\nBundle : Other thirdparty files and util files will be bundled along with route file (will not download separately).\n\nHowever file types can be overriden through configuration. You can learn more about it here. Take a look at the below code snippet to see how it works.\n\n```html\nimport \"a.js\" ; //@bundle\nimport \"b.js\" ; //@resources\nimport \"c.js\" ; //@dependencies\nimport \"d.js\" ; //@resources @if a<b\nimport \"e.js\" ; //@if b<c @dependencies\n```\n```javascript\n//#start resources\nimport \"f.js\" ;\nimport \"h.js\" ;\nimport \"i.js\" ;\n//#end resources\n```\n```javascript\n//#start dependencies\nimport \"l.js\" ; //@if b<c\nimport \"j.js\" ;\nimport \"k.js\" ;\n//#end dependencies\n```\n```javascript\nimport \"m.js\" ;\nimport \"g.js\";\n//#start if c<d\nimport \"m.js\" ;\nimport \"g.js\";\n//#end if\n```\nData Fetch\n\nRouter plays a great role in fetching the data and providing it to the user. There are three processes such as pre-processing, actual data fetch and post-processing to assist you with data fetching.\n\nPre-Processing\n\nPre-processing such as permission checks and redirections is carried out in beforeFetch method of a route. Have a look at the below code snippet to check how it works.\n\n```javascript\nbeforeFetch(params){ /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string'} */\n  if(!Permissions.getPermission( params.queryParams.filter )){\n    this.navigation.abort();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nHere, in the beforeFetch hook, the permission is being checked and if the permission is not granted, the route gets aborted. You can also return a Promise from the beforeFetch. The Router will wait for this promise to be resolved before proceeding with the execution of the next method of the Route. You can get the returned value of the beforeFetch hook using this.$.beforeFetch.\n\nActual Data Fetch\n\nFetching of data is carried out in the fetch method of the Route. Here is where you make the calls to the Data Store or have your own requests to the server for getting the data. Have a look at the below code to get an insight.\n\n```javascript\nfetch( params ){ /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string'} */\n  return this.$db.getAll(schema : Todo);\n}\n```\n\nMost often you will be returning a promise from this hook. Router will wait for this promise to be resolved before proceeding with the execution of the next method of the Route.\n\nThe data returned from the fetch will be available in the route instance under \"currentData\" property.\n\nPost-Processing\n\nYou can make any post-processing on the data in the afterFetch method of the Router. If you want to change the entire data with a new object, you can do so by setting the \"data\" property of the route instance.\n\n```javascript\nafterFetch( data , params ){ /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string'} */\n  data.displayRecords = true;\n  data.list = [];\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to make some changes to the data already present, you can do so by making changes to the \"data\" argument of the method.\n\n```javascript\nafterFetch( data , params ){ /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string'} */\n  this.currentData = { \"todoList\" : data , filter : params.queryParams.filter };\n}\n```\n\nLike beforeFetch and fetch method, afterFetch can also return a Promise, however, the value returned from this method won't be set in the route's fetch callback.\n\nThe above-mentioned three process(pre-processing, actual data fetch, post-processing)works in a sequential order. For each route, even if it is a nested route say a/b/c, the route 'a' performs all three processes then the route 'b' performs the same three processes, and then the last route 'c' performs the three process. However, if you want all the nested routed to undergo the processes parallelly for fast rendering, Router lets you do it with Force Fetch.\n\nForce Fetch\n\nAs a performance-enhancing option, Router allows you to fetch data requests of nested routes in parallel. Ideally, the processing of a child route will take place once the parent route is rendered. But in cases where you need to override this default behavior and have data fetch requests sent parallelly, you can opt for \"forceFetch\" option in the route.\n\n```javascript\nclass Home extends Route {\n  forceFetch( params ) { /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string'} */\n    /* returns boolean.*/\n  }\n  (OR)\n  forceFetch = boolean\n};\n```\n\nWhile using forceFetch option, the routes' data fetch must be independent of each other. This is because the routes' executed in parallel gets resolved at a different time and hence the child route may or may not have the parent's data.\n\nRendering the View\n\nThe render method of the Route takes care of the rendering the view for a specific Route. sLyte follows a parent-child's data, wherein the child view (container) should be contained by the parent view (container). Say, if we have three routes name A, B, C respectively. A's view should contain B's view and C's view. B's view should in turn contain C's view.\n\nIf a navigation is made from A.B.C to A.B, then there will be no rendering, Because A and B are already rendered.\n\nComponent Rendering\n\nYou can specify the component you wish to render along with the outlet where the component needs to be rendered. Router will then create the component and set the data as the component's data and render it in the specified outlet.\n\n```javascript\nrender( data, params ){ /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string'} */\n  return { outlet : '#outlet' , component : 'todo-list' } /* reRender : true (to re-render a component)*/\n}\n```\n\nAs stated earlier, the data will be set to the component. Hence it needs to be an Object. If not, Router will throw an error. Re-rendering the component will initialize the component once again completely\n\n```javascript\nafterFetch( data , params ){ /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string'} */\n  this.currentData = { \"todoList\" : data };\n}\n```\n\nWhen there is change in dynamic param or query param of a route and if a same component is returned to a route, then the component will not be re-initialized.\n\nHTML Rendering\n\nRouter also supports rendering HTML directly instead of rendering a component, in order to support applications which don't use lyte Component.\n\n```javascript\nrender( data, params ){ /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string'} */\n  return { outlet : '#outlet' , html : `<p>html to be rendered</p>` }\n}\n```\nBefore Template Destroy\n\nbeforeTemplateDestroy hook is called when a route is removed from view. To be precise, this event can be set globally to remove a component/html of a route from view. This hook gets called only after the next transition gets rendered.\n\n```javascript\nlyte.addEventListener(\"beforeTemplateDestroy\", function(e) {\n  // remove scroll event or events bound to component\n});\n```\nDid Destroy\n\nBy default, when route navigations are made, the router removes the view part of the previous route. If you wish to perform any function before removing the route, the router provides an event to notify view removal.\n\n```javascript\ndidDestroy( data, params ){ /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string'} */\n  this.removeListener()\n}\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "QUERY PARAMS\nIntroduction\n\nWhile establishing a route, query params play an important role. Query params are a set of key-value pairs that are part of the URL after \"?\".\n\nWith the query params, you can provide the additional information to the process.\n\nHere are a few sample query params.\n\nfilter\npageNumber\nperPageCount\nsorting\n\nYou can provide the default values for these queryParams in map.js just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nclass testAppMap extends RouterMap {\n  map() {\n    this.route( \"authors\" , { \"path\" : \"authors\" } ,() => {\n      this.route(\"list\",{\"path\": \"list?page=1&perPage=10\"});\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\nFactors To Consider\n\nThere are a few factors that require your attention before setting up the query param.\n\nCaching\n\nLet us first understand what stickiness is all about. This is also a provision to maintain the query params from one navigation to another (cache query param). Say, you have n number of query params for a navigation and you need to change only one param and make a new navigation, instead of providing all the query params, cache query params would let you maintain it for the new navigation.\n\nCaching being an important factor to consider, comes up with a global configuration, which defaults to be true. In order to disable it, you need to provide cache as false to router configuration.\n\nThe global configuration for cache query params can be provided as follows.\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppMap } from \"./maps/map\";\n\nclass AppRouter extends Router {\n  getConfig() {\n    return {\n      queryParamOptions : {\n        cache : false\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nsLyte also gives you a provision to change the query params individually. Have a look at the below code snippet to understand how it works.\n\n```javascript\nclass List extends Route {\n  static queryParams = [ 'page' , 'perPage' , { \"sort\" : { \"cache\" : false }}]\n}\n```\nRefresh Data on Query Param Change\n\nWhenever a query param is changed for a route the corresponding route's hook gets called. If you want the route's hook not to be called, you can set refreshfetch as false.\n\n```javascript\nclass List extends Route {\n  static queryParams = [ 'page' , 'perPage' , { \"sort\" : { \"refreshData\" : false , \"cache\" : false } }]\n}\n```\nRoute navigation using Query Param\n\nNow, while navigating a route, you may require a query param and you can use it with navigateTo, setQueryParams, replaceWith.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "ACTIONS\nIntroduction\n\nActions are similar to events. Action on a route will be propagated to the parent route unless it is stopped explicitly. Give a read to understand how action handling works. An action can be stopped from being propagated to the parent by returning false (boolean) to an action. Some of the actions are as follows.\n\nonBeforeLoad\n\nWhen navigation is initiated successfully, onBeforeLoad action gets called. This is the first action to get called while establishing a route. Thus it would be an ideal place to show the loading state of a navigation. And loading state of a navigation can be stopped in didNavigate callback or in afterRouteNavigation\n\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n  return {\n    onBeforeLoad : function( params ) {\n      showLoadingState();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nonError\n\nonError action gets called on the following three conditions\n\nWhen the imports fail\nWhen there is an error in the data fetch\nWhen there is a JS error in requirements/data fetch methods\n\nWhen any one of the mentioned errors occurs, the navigation will be paused and the onError action will be called. Based on the priority of error, the navigation can be resumed or aborted. By default, navigation will be aborted after the onError action has been called. So if a navigation is not resumed in onError, it will remain aborted.\n\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n  return {\n    onError : function( error , pausedTrans , params , hook ) {\n      if( error.lowPriorityResource ){\n        pausedTrans.resume();\n      } else {\n        this.navigationTo( \"home\" );\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nwillNavigate\n\nwillNavigate is to notify a route that a navigation is going to be made from the current route. You can prevent the new navigation from happening, in cases where you want the user to be on the same route.\n\nLet us consider an example, where a user is editing a particular entity and clicks on the \"Home\" button by mistake. You can use the will willNavigate method to display a popup asking for confirmation from the user to quit editing.\n\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n  return {\n    willNavigate : function( trans ) {\n      var pausedTrans = trans.pause();\n      if( this.currentData.user.$.isDirty ){\n        var conf = confirm( 'Are you sure to proceed, there are unsaved data?' );\n        if( !conf ){\n          pausedTrans.abort();\n        } else {\n          pausedTrans.resume();\n        }\n      }\n      return false;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf there is any common handling for a navigation, then it can be handled in the router with beforeRouteNavigation which gets called before a navigation is done (Before URL is changed).\n\ndidNavigate\n\ndidNavigate notifies the route that the navigation is completed.\n\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n  return {\n    didNavigate : function( params ){\n      hideLoadingState();\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf there is any common handling to be done after a navigation is completed, then it can be handled in the router afterRouteNavigation, which gets called after a navigation is done.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "ROUTE NAVIGATION\nIntroduction\n\nLet us consider an example, where the user doesn't have permission to view his profile until he logs in. Generally, an application would redirect him to the login page and after successful login, redirects him back to the profile page. In such cases, navigation plays a major role.\n\nRoute Navigation\n\nRouter allows you to handle navigation using the following methods.\n\ngo-to\n\nIf you are planning to make a route navigation with HTML, using go-to will be the right choice. go-to can be used inside a component or html. By default, it creates an anchor element. Custom HTML can be created instead of anchor tag using lt-prop-custom property. Have a look at the below code snippet for better understanding.\n\n```html\n<go-to lt-prop-route=\"home.tab\" lt-prop-dp='[\"Lead\"]' lt-prop-qp='{\"default\" : \"true\"}' lt-prop-target=\"_blank\" lt-prop-data='{\"option\": \"20\" ,\"page\" : \"2\"}'>\n  Link 1\n</go-to>\n<go-to lt-prop-route=\"home.tab\" lt-prop-dp='[\"Lead\"]' lt-prop-qp='{\"default\" : \"true\"}' lt-prop-target=\"_blank\" lt-prop-data='{\"option\": \"20\" ,\"page\" : \"2\"}' lt-prop-custom>\n  Link 2\n  <span>\n    This is custom span\n  </span>\n</go-to>\n```\nAttribute list:\n\nHere is a list of attributes that can be used with respect to go-to navigation.\n\nPROERTY NAME\tTYPE\tDESCRIPTION\nlt-prop-route\tString\tRoute name\nlt-prop-dp\tStringArray\t- Dynamic params. ([\"one\",\"two\"])\nlt-prop-qp\tStringObject\t- Query param object. ('{\"per_page\" : \"5\"}')\nlt-prop-fragment\tString\tScroll to certain element on the page with an id.\nlt-prop-data\tObject\tNavigation data(which will be pushed to the history stack)\nlt-prop-refresh-route\tString/Boolean\tTo refresh from specified route, when the current route is same as specified route. By default it is set to false.\nlt-prop-begin-from\tString\tForced refresh from a particular route. If same route, lt-prop-refresh-route has priority\nlt-prop-replace\tBoolean\tTo use replaceWith API for navigation. By default, navigate-to will be used.\nlt-prop-custom\tBoolean\tThis property can be used to create a specific element instead of anchor tag.\nlt-prop-<<attrs>>\tNA\ttarget|id|class|style|rel|title will be set to anchor tag. The above mentioned other attributes can also be provided which will be set to go-to tag.\n\nEvents and other properties can be set to go-to element.\n\nrefresh\n\nRefresh method of route is useful for refreshing the current routes. Let us consider an example, where you are in 'a.b.c.d' route. If 'b.c.d' route needs to be refreshed, refresh method needs to be called from 'b' route.\n\nHave a look at the below code, to understand its working.\n\n```javascript\nclass Blogs extends Route {\n  actions : {\n    refreshRoute : function(){\n      var obj = {};\n      obj.refreshTemplate = true;\n      this.refresh(obj);\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy default refreshing a route does not re-initialise the components in a route.\n\nsetQueryParams\n\nsetQueryParams is to navigate to the same route with query param changes. This can be done in that particular route instance.\n\n```javascript\nclass Blogs extends Route {\n  actions : {\n    changePageNumber : function( value ){\n      this.setQueryParams({ page : value });\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nsetDynamicParam\n\nsetDynamicParams is to navigate to the same route with dynamic param changes. This can be done in that particular route instance.\n\n```javascript\nclass Blogs extends Route {\n  actions : {\n    changeVersion : function( value ) {\n      this.setDynamicParams( value ) ;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nnavigateTo\n\nnavigate to new route with a new entry being pushed to history array can be carried out using this method.\n\n```javascript\nif(this.navigation.info.route == \"index\"){\n  this.navigateTo('index.author.view','authorID001', { type : 'detail' });\n  /* WITH MIN DATA : this.navigationTo(routeName, dynamicParams..., queryParamsObject)\n  OR\n  this.navigateTo({\n    route : routeName,\n    dynamicParams : [\"string\"],\n    queryParams : {},\n    fragment : \"string\"',\n    refreshRoute : \"string\", //used on same url, history will not be pushed.\n    startFrom : \"string\"' //forced refresh from specified route\n  })\n  */\n}\n```\nreplaceWith\n\nAny new navigation requiring to replace the existing history entry can be done using this method. This, replaces the current history entry.\n\n```javascript\nif(this.navigation.info.route == \"index\"){\n  this.replaceWith('index.author.view','authorID001', { type : 'detail' });\n  /* WITH MIN DATA : this.replaceWith(routeName, dynamicParams..., queryParamsObject)\n  OR\n  this.replaceWith({\n    route : routeName,\n    dynamicParams : [\"string\"],\n    queryParams : {},\n    fragment : \"string\"',\n    refreshRoute : \"string\", //will refresh the specified route on same url\n    startFrom : \"string\"' //forced refresh from specified route\n  })*/\n}\n```\n\nrefresh, setQueryParams, navigateTo and replaceWith method returns navigation object. Using navigation object, data can be set to new navigation. The object in \"data\" key will be pushed to history.\n\nA route navigation is set to be complete when didNavigate hook is executed, any navigation before this hook will be assumed as a new navigation, thus executes all the navigation hooks from the beginning. To make it more clear, let's say you are in /todo and used redirect (using replaceWith or using navigateTo) to /todo/create in afterRender, then both todo route and create route will be executed. If you redirect the same in 'didNavigate', only create route will be executed.\n\nThe field 'Fragment' supports only the HTML5 history file. With this, you get the flexibility to scroll to certain element on the page with an id(provided the DOM is loaded). The field 'Refreshroute' lets you refresh from specified route, when the current route is same as specified route. The field 'StartFrom', lets to refresh or begin the transition to a different route from a specified route. It is also important to note that while using StartFrom, and if the transition is happening to the same route then RefreshRoute takes priority.\n\ndivert\n\nbeforeFetch and divert are ideal methods to make a route navigation. Once permission checks are done and if user does not have permission for a page, then he can be redirected.\n\n```javascript\nbeforeFetch : function( params ){  /* params = {queryParams : {} , dynamicParam : 'string' } */\n  if(!Permissions.getPermission ( params.queryParams.filter)){\n    this.navigation.abort();\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn some cases, redirection may occur based on the data fetched in a route. Such redirections can be handled in redirect method.\n\n```javascript\ndivert : function( model , params ){\n  if( this.navigation.info.route == \"index\" ){\n    this.replaceWith( 'todo.create' )\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOn every route execution, divert method gets called. This ensures that you can do the redirections on any navigation, even if it involves a navigation between child routes.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Routing - Scenarios\nBasic CRUD\n\nLet us consider a scenario where you need to preform CRUD operation(say author). \"author\" route will be used to fetch common data and common components required for CRUD operation. Subroutes will be used to display and perform specific task like create, read, update and delete respectively.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RouterMap } from \"@slyte/router\";\n\nclass AppMap extends RouterMap {\n\tmap() {\n\t\tthis.route( \"authors\" , { path : \"/authors\" } , () => {\n\t\t\tthis.route( 'index' , { path : \"/\" }); \t// This route displays the list of authors.\n\t\t\tthis.route( \"create\" , { path : \"/create\" }); \t// This route creates a new author.\n\t\t\tthis.route( \"edit\" , { path : \"/edit\" }); \t\t// This route edits the author details.\n\t\t\tthis.route( \"delete\" , { path : \"/delete\" }); \t// This route deletes author record.\n\t\t});\n\t}\n}\n\nexport default AppMap;\n```\nLoading State\n\nThe loading state can be notified either from route(local handling) or router file(global handling). Route file is provided with \"onBeforeLoad\" and \"didNavigate\" for notifying user or it can be notified from \"beforeRouteNavigation\" and \"afterRouteNavigation\" provided in router.js(global handling).\n\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n\treturn() {\n\t\tonBeforeLoad : function(){\n\t\t\tstartLoadingState();\n\t\t},\n\t\tdidNavigate : function(){\n\t\t\tendLoadingState();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n```javascript\nimport { AppMap } from \"./maps/map\";\n\nclass AppRouter extends Router {\n\tlookups(){\n\t\treturn [];\n\t}\n\tgetConfig() {\n\tvar config = {\n\t\tbaseURL : '',\n\t\thistory : \"html5\"\n\t\tbaseMap : AppMap\n\t}\n\treturn config;\n\t}\n\tbeforeRouteNavigation = function(prev,current) {\n\t\tstartLoadingState();\n\t}\n\tafterRouteNavigation = function(current) {\n\t\tendLoadingState();\n\t}\n}\n```\nwillNavigate\n\nIf a tranisition requires user confirmation, willNavigate hook of the route comes into the picture. Ongoing navigation can be paused based on the user's interacion, and the navigation can also be resumed or aborted with it.\n\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n\treturn {\n\t\twillNavigate : function( trans ) {\n\t\t\tvar paused = trans.pause();\n\t\t\tvar result = confirm( \"Are you sure to proceed ? Your unsaved data might be lost.\" );\n\t\t\tif( result ){\n\t\t\t\tpaused.resume();\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\tpaused.abort();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\nforceFetch\n\nIn case of nested routes,the child routes will be executed only after the parent route gets executed. To override this default behaviour, sLyte has come up with an attribute forceFetch for the routes. If forceFetch is set to true,then both the parent and child routes will get executed parallelly provided the models in both parent and child route must be independent of each other.\n\n```javascript\nforceFetch(params){\n\t/* returns boolean.*/\n}\n(OR)\nforceFetch = boolean\n```\n```javascript\nclass Edit extends Router {\n\tforceFetch = true\n};\n```\n```javascript\nclass Create extends Router {\n\tforceFetch(){\n\n\t}\n};\n```\n\nThe models of child route and parent route must be independent of each other.\n\nRefreshing Parent\n\nBy default, a route which is already rendered will not be fetched/rendered once again unless there is a change in any of query param or dynamic param. \"refresh\" method will refresh a route which is already rendered. Let us consider a navigation between \"home.create\" to \"home.edit\", home route will not be rendered. If we need to re-render it, we can use \"refresh\" method in beforeFetch hook of edit route.\n\n```javascript\nclass Edit extends Router {\n\tstatic actions() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\"on-callCreate\" : function(){\n\t\t\t\tvar trans = this.navigateTo( 'home.create' );\n\t\t\t\ttrans.refresh = true;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n};\n```\n```javascript\nclass Create extends Router {\n\tbeforeFetch(){\n\t\tif( this.navigation.refresh ){\n\t\t\tthis.parent.refresh();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n};\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 27,
    "content": "DATA\nIntroduction\n\nThe Data Store is an integral component of the sLyte framework, designed to handle the storage, manipulation, validation, and access of data efficiently. Its primary function is to act as a bridge between the client (the front-end of the application) and the server (back-end), facilitating seamless communication and data transfer. By serving as this intermediary, the Data Store simplifies how data is handled throughout the application.\n\nKey Responsibilities of the Data Store\nData Fetching\n\nOne of the central tasks of the Data Store is to fetch data from server-side API endpoints. Whether these endpoints are RESTful services or GraphQL queries, the Data Store ensures that the correct data is retrieved and made available for use on the client side.\n\nInstead of requiring multiple requests or complex code to fetch data from different parts of the system, the Data Store provides a unified interface for data retrieval, greatly simplifying how applications interact with their back-end services.\n\nCaching\n\nCaching plays a vital role here. By temporarily storing data, the Data Store reduces the need for redundant network requests, thus optimizing performance and improving response times. Users experience faster interactions since data can be retrieved from the cache rather than repeatedly querying the server.\n\nData Manipulation & Validation\n\nThe Data Store doesn't merely act as a passive data handler—it actively manages and validates the data it stores. When an application modifies data (e.g., when a user updates their profile or submits a form), the Data Store ensures that these changes are validated before they are sent back to the server.\n\nThis layer of validation is crucial because it ensures data integrity, preventing malformed or incomplete data from being sent to the server. The Data Store checks the data against predefined rules and conditions, maintaining consistency in the application.\n\nSaving Data to the Server\n\nWhen changes are made to data on the client side, the Data Store streamlines the process of syncing these changes back to the server. It ensures that updates, new entries, or deletions are transmitted with minimal effort on the developer's part.\n\nThe Data Store provides developers with callbacks and lifecycle events, making it easier to trigger actions at specific points during the data transaction process, such as before or after sending data to the server.\n\nSingle Point of Communication\n\nIn traditional systems, client-server communication might be scattered throughout the application, making it harder to manage and debug. With the sLyte Data Store, all communication happens through a single point, making it easier to maintain, monitor, and optimize.\n\nThis centralized communication pattern significantly reduces the complexity of building and maintaining a robust application, as all data-related interactions are channeled through a well-defined interface.\n\nElevating the Application with REST & GraphQL Support\n\nOne of the key advantages of the sLyte Data Store is its flexibility in handling different types of API protocols. By supporting both REST and GraphQL endpoints, the Data Store empowers developers to choose the best communication strategy for their specific needs.\n\nREST\n\nREST is a widely-used protocol for interacting with resources in a simple and stateless manner. The Data Store’s ability to handle REST endpoints means that it can easily fetch or update resources using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n\nGraphQL\n\nGraphQL provides more flexibility in querying data by allowing clients to specify exactly what data they need in a single request, as opposed to REST, where endpoints return predefined sets of data.\n\nBy integrating GraphQL, the Data Store enhances the efficiency of data transfer, reducing the number of requests and the amount of data being sent back and forth between the client and server.\n\nUnified Callbacks for Seamless Control\n\nAnother standout feature of the Data Store is its use of callbacks at every step of the data-handling process. These callbacks are defined in a centralized location, providing developers with full control over how data is fetched, manipulated, validated, and stored.\n\nFor instance:\n\nA callback can be triggered before sending a request to the server to validate the data.\nAnother callback might fire after a successful data retrieval to process or format the data.\nCallbacks can also be used to handle errors gracefully, ensuring that the application behaves predictably even when things go wrong.\n\nBy having these callbacks consolidated into a single system, developers don’t need to chase down functions scattered across the codebase. Everything is managed in one place, which reduces complexity and makes the development process much smoother.\n\nData Flow Architecture\n\nHave a look at the below image to visualize the working of data store\n\nBenefits of Using the sLyte Data Store\n\nIn summary, the Data Store provides numerous benefits that elevate the sLyte framework’s capabilities:\n\nEfficiency: Reduces the number of network requests by caching and storing data locally.\nSimplified Communication: Acts as a single, central point for client-server interaction, reducing complexity in application architecture.\nFlexibility: Supports both REST and GraphQL protocols, offering developers the freedom to choose the best data-fetching method.\nRobust Data Handling: Manages data manipulation, validation, and syncing with the server, ensuring the integrity and consistency of data.\nExtensibility: With centralized callbacks, developers can easily extend the functionality of the Data Store without modifying core logic.\nFinal thoughts\n\nBy incorporating the Data Store into your application, you can ensure that your data flows smoothly between the client and server, while also providing a scalable and maintainable solution for managing the application’s data requirements.\n\nIn short, the Data Store serves as the backbone for handling data in your application, providing a reliable, efficient, and flexible approach to managing the complex interactions between client-side components and server-side APIs.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

The best part is that it can have multiple db registries for an app.\n\nBase db Class\n\nOn default, while creating an app, the db registry gets created in datastore/db.js. With this you create a base db class from data store.\n\nThis is how the db registry file looks like.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Db, RESTConnector, RESTSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass AppDb extends Db{\n  static Connector = RESTConnector;\n  static Serializer = RESTSerializer;\n}\nexport { AppDb };\n```\n\nBase connector and serializer of the app has to be given in Connector and Serializer static property in base Db class.\n\nIf there is any applicationConnector / applicationSerializer, it can be defined in Connector and Serialzer static property in the base Db class as follows\n\n```javascript\nimport { Db } from \"@slyte/data/src/Db\";\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./serializers/application\";\nimport { ApplicationConnector } from \"./connectors/application\";\nclass AppDb extends Db{\n  static Connector = ApplicationConnector;\n  static Serializer = ApplicationSerializer;\n}\nexport { AppDb };\n```\ndb Instantiation\n\nData store instance can be created through lookups in base application class.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Lyte } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { AppDb } from \"data/db\";\nclass App extends Lyte{\n  lookups(){\n    return [{db:AppDb}];\n  }\n}\nexport { App }\n```\n\nNote: Across this document, in the places where db instance utils has to be used, it will be refered as \"this.$db\", considering db is the name of the base class db lookup given.\n\nUsing db Instance\n\nSince appDb is included as a lookup, it can be accessed in this context of component and the route provided that it is included as lookups in their base class such as ComponentRegistry and the Router class as follows.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ComponentRegistry } from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {AppDb} from \"../data/db.js\";\nclass AppComponentRegistry extends ComponentRegistry {\n  lookups() {\n    return [{db:AppDb}];\n  }\n}\nexport { AppComponentRegistry };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Router } from \"@slyte/router\";\nclass AppRouter extends Router {\n    lookups(){\n                                return [{db:AppDb}];\n    }\n}\nexport { AppRouter }\n```\n\nThis \"db\" lookup can be used in the \"this\" context of component, route, connector, serializer with property \"$db\" as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nclass BlogList extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      // Data that is processed in template.\n    }\n  }\n  init(){\n\tthis.$db.cache.get({schema:User});\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogList};\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nclass Home extends Route {\n  static queryParams = [\"page\"];\n  model(){\n\treturn this.$db.cache.get({schema:User});\n  }\n}\nexport { Home };\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Data store\nDefining a Schema\n\nSchema is the blueprint of the data and it defines the data's properties and relations, similar to defining a table in MySQL. Schema, plays a major role while creating a db. A schema can easily be created with the help of CLI.\n\nlyte generate schema schemaName\n\nHere is a sample schema created for your reference\n\nlyte generate schema User\n\nNote: It is always recommended to start the schema name with a capital letter.\n\nCLI will automatically add Schema.register() during the compilation. For any dynamic schema registration, register schema like below\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n    props(){\n    }\n}\n```\n\nJump into schema to know more about it.\n\nDefining Props in a Schema\n\nprop is an util which can be imported from @slyte/core package. The syntax of using it is as follows\n\npropName : prop( type , { options });\n\nFollowing are the supported primitive data types,\n\nstring\nnumber\nboolean\nobject\narray\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n    props(){\n        name: prop(\"string\"),\n        number: prop(\"number\"),\n        isRegistered: prop(\"boolean\"),\n        info: prop(\"object\")\n    }\n}\n```\nPrimary Key\n\nPrimary key is the unique identifier of schema. By default, the 'id' prop will be considered as the primary key. Other properties can also be configured as primary key of the schema, like below.\n\npropName : prop( type , { primaryKey: true });\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n    props(){\n        return {\n            uid : prop( \"string\", { primaryKey : true } ),\n            name : prop( \"string\" )\n        }\n    }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nComposite Key\n\nComposite key is combination of two or more keys that can uniquely identity an entity in the schema. Defining a composite key is quite similar to that of defining a primary key but here the primaryKey option can be given in more than one attribute. Here is a sample code for your reference.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      email : prop( \"string\", { primaryKey : true } ),\n      id : prop(\"string\", { primaryKey : true, baseKey : true}),\n      name : prop( \"string\" )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nConnector\n\nBy supporting both REST and GraphQL endpoints, the Data Store empowers developers to choose the best communication strategy for their specific needs.\n\nA connector is a callback layer provided by sLyte. This comes in your help, when you are in need to set or modify URL formats, headers, method,queryParams etc. Being a single point contact between the db and the server, you can easily configure and modify the request related information with several call backs.\n\nStructuring a connector\n\nBefore structuring a connector, it is vital to define the base connector from which you can extend the schema connector. Learn from here to define a base connector.\n\nLet us see how a connector can be structured with REST and GraphQL\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTConnector } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass ApplicationConnector extends RESTConnector{\n    host = \"https://crm.zoho.com\";\n    namespace = \"/crm/v1\";\n}\nexport { ApplicationConnector };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationConnector } from \"./application\";\nclass UserConnector extends ApplicationConnector{\n    requestURL({url}){\n        return url;\n    }\n}\nexport { UserConnector };\n```\n\nHave a look at the detailed section about connectors for better understanding.\n\nSerializer\n\nBy supporting both REST and GraphQL endpoints, the Data Store empowers developers to choose the best communication strategy for their specific needs.\n\nSerializer is also a callback layer where the request or the response can be either formatted or modified before being sent or received from the server.\n\nStructuring a serializer\n\nBefore structuring a serializer, it is vital to define the base serializer from which you can extend the schema serializer. Learn from here to define a base serializer.\n\nLet us see how a serializer can be structured with REST and GraphQL.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass ApplicationSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n    normalizePayload({payLoad}){\n        return payLoad;\n    }\n}\nexport { ApplicationSerializer };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n    normalizePayload({payLoad}){\n        payLoad = super.normalizePayload(...arguments);\n        return payLoad;\n    }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\n\nHave a look at the detailed section about serializer for better understanding.\n\nConfigure Schema Specific Connector/Serializer\n\nA connector / serializer can easily be created with the help of CLI as below,\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate connector user; //extends RESTConnector\nlyte generate serializer user; //extends RESTSerializer\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate connector user --type=\"gql\"; //extends GqlConnector\nlyte generate serializer user --type=\"gql\"; //extends GqlSerializer\n```\n\nFollowing is the example of REST specific user connector and serializer,\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTConnector } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass UserConnector extends RESTConnector{\n}\nexport { UserConnector };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { RESTSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass UserSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\n\nThis connector / serializer has to be added to Connector / Serializer static property of that particular schema as below\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { UserConnector } from \"../connectors/user\";\nimport { UserSerializer } from \"../serializer/user\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n    static Connector = UserConnector;\n    static Serializer = UserSerializer;\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nEntity\n\nWhile the table being considered as a schema, each record inside the table is considered to be an entity. This entity serves to be the instance of the schema. You can create a new entity in the existing db. Data store gives you the particular entity's states and methods in $ property inside the entity object. So with entity.$ you can set and get the properties and methods.\n\n$entity\n\nAll properties and methods provided by data store will be available in entity.$ scope. Since entity holds all the properties of a schema, all the entity properties and methods are defined under entity.$, in order to not pollute the entity namespace.\n\nEntity States\n\nThere are four states to determine the current state of an entity\n\nIsNew\n\nWhen an entity is newly created, this property must be set true.\n\nIsModified\n\nIsModified must be set true, if a change has to be made to an entity.\n\nIsDeleted\n\nWhen an entity is deleted, its isDeleted property must be set true.\n\nIsError\n\nThis property has to be set true, if there are any validation errors.\n\nValidation\n\nIf a persistent data is being added to Data store via push or getAll or getEntity methods in db, data will not be validated by default. Any persistent data from the server will not be validated.\n\nAny change made to the entity will be validated, only if the data is being set via data set utils or entity's data set utils.\n\nWith respect to non-persistent data entity creation data will be validated upon create itself.\n\nData caching\n\nData caching is a technique which is used to store or cache the entity's data in the browser's cache to improve performance and reduce latency. Additionaly, datastore lets you cache the data with query parameters,with custom cacheQuery,cacheData option\n\nIndexedDB\n\nIt is a centralised web storage solution provided by the browser to store significant amounts of data with a same origin policy. Data store provides an option to store the db data in the indexedDB. You can learn more about it here.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 30,
    "content": "Relationships\n\nData store includes several built-in relationship types to help you define your schemas and their relationship with other schemas. These relationships help to establish connections between the schemas in your application and can be used to pass the data between their entities.\n\nTo define the relationship between the models, export the methods(\"one\",\"many\") from @slyte/core package has to be used.\n\nOne-way-relation\n\nTo declare an one way relationship between two schemas, relation can be defined in any one of the schema. It is not needed to define the relation in both schemas. Let us consider two schema namely 'user' and 'profile'. Now that user schema is in relation with the profile schema and it can be defined as follows.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Profile extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      user : one( User )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Profile };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      username : prop( \"string\" )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nOne-to-One\n\nIn an one-to-one relationship, one entity in a schema can be associated with just one entity in another schema. To declare an one-to-one relationship between two schemas, use \"one\" method, followed by the schema with which it has one-to-one relationship with. Have a look at the below code snippet to understand better. Here, the two schemas, user and profile are being in one-to-one relationship and they can be defined as follows.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Profile } from \"../profile.js\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      username : prop( \"string\" ),\n      activeProfile : one( Profile )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Profile extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n       currentUser: one( User )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Profile };\n```\nOne-to-Many\n\nIn an one-to-many relationship, a entity of a schema can be associated with multiple entities in another schema. Let us consider an example of a blog. The blog also has many comments and they belong to a particular blog post.\n\nTo declare an one-to-many relationship between two schemas, use one method in combination with many method. Let us consider a model 'blog' and a model 'comment' with a one-to-many relationship, where one instance of 'blog' is connected to multiple instances of 'comment'. They can be defined as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../comment.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      userComment : many( Comment )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Comment extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      blog : one( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Comment };\n```\nMany-to-Many\n\nIn a many-to-many relationship, multiple entities in a schema can be associated with multiple entities in another schema. For example, a blog post can have many tags and a tag can be used in many blog posts. To declare a many-to-many relationship between two models, use many method. Let's define a model 'blog' and a model 'tag' with a many-to-many relationship, where multiple instances of 'blog' are connected to multiple instances of 'tag'. They can be defined as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Tag } from \"../tag.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      tags : many( Tag )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Tag extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      blogs : many( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Tag };\n```\nReflexive Relations\n\nA reflexive relationship is when a schema has a relationship with itself. You can define a reflexive relationship by specifying the schema's own name in one / many method. For example, let's define a model 'User' with a reflexive relationship:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      bestFriend : one( User, { inverse: \"bestFriend\"} )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nPolymorphism\n\nPolymorphism allows you to inherit the functionalities of a base model into a derived model. Polymorphism is highly beneficial when you require the attributes of a model to be extended to another model, where they can be used by the derived model directly. This is done by using the keyword extends, followed by the name of the base model\n\nHave a look at the below code snippet to understand how polymorphism works. Here the model,'User', being the base model which is in relationship with the model'blog'. The other two models 'employee' and 'admin' gets extended from the base model 'User'.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      reviewer : many( User , {polymorphic:true}),\n      collaborator : many ( User, {polymorphic:true})\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      \"_type\" : prop( \"string\" ), // This is a mandate attribute whose value will be either admin | employee\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      phone : prop( \"string\" ),\n      blogs : many( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Employee extends User{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      designation: prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Employee };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Admin extends User{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      permission: prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Admin };\n```\nExplicit Inverses\n\nIf two schemas are related to each other more than once, you need to explicitly specify the attribute based on which they are related. For example, a blog can have both reviewers and collaborators as users. The schema 'blog' therefore has an explicit inverse relationship with the schema 'users' in this context. To define an explicit inverse relationship between two schemas, you can use the 'inverse' option in many. Let's define the schema 'user' and the schema 'blog' with an explicit inverse relationship as follows:\n\nA blog has many users as reviewers.\nA blog has many users as collaborators\n\nNote: An explicit inverse relationship between two schemas can be specified in either of the schemas.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      reviewed_blogs : many( Blog , { inverse : \"reviewer\" }),\n      edited_blogs : many( Blog , { inverse : \"collaborator\" })\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { User } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      reviewer : many( User),\n      collaborator : many( User)\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n\nThe api response for blog api should be like this\n\n```javascript\n{\n  blogs : [{\n    id : \"8675309\",\n    name : \"Blog Title\",\n    reviewer : [{\n      id : \"user1\",\n      name : \"userName\",\n      phone : \"12345\",\n      _ type : \"admin\",   // This value will be received from the server OR computed in the serializer\n      permission : \"ALL\"\n    }],\n    collaborator : [{\n      id : \"user2\",\n      name : \"userName1\",\n      phone : \"123457\",\n      _ type : \"employee\",\n      designation : \"MTS\"\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nNow that you have seen the relationship, it is high time to see how the entities can be related to each other.\n\nRelate the Entities\nusing object\n\nAn object can be passed in the relation key as a data in db's push/newEntity or entity.$.set to relate it.\n\nFor push, passed object will either be created as a new persisted entity or merged with the existing entity(if that entity is already present) and related\nFor newEntity / entity.$.set,it will either try to create a new entity & relate or it will set an error in entity saying the entity with primaryKey values already present\n```javascript\nthis.$db.push({schema:User, data:{ id:'1', profile:{id:'1'} }});\n```\n```javascript\nthis.$db.newEntity({schema:User, data:{ id:'1', profile:{id:'1'}}});\n```\n```javascript\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.set(\"profile\", {id:'1'});\n```\nusing primaryKey value\n\nPrimaryKey values can be passed in the relation key as a data in db's push, newEntity / entity.$.set. If that record is present in store, it will be related. Following are the ways to use it,\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.push({schema:User, data:{ id:'1', profile:\"1\" }});\n```\n```javascript\nthis.$db.newEntity({schema:User, data:{ id:'1', profile:\"1\" }});\n```\n```javascript\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.set(\"profile\", \"1\");\n```\nusing entity instance\n\nEntity instances can be passed in the relation key as a data in db's push, newEntity / entity.$.set. to relate it. Following are the ways to use it,\n\n```javascript\nimport { Profile } from \"../profile.js\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nvar profileRecord = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:Profile, pK:\"1\"});\nthis.$db.push({schema:User, data:{ id:'1', profile:profileRecord }});\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Profile } from \"../profile.js\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nvar profileRecord = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:Profile, pK:\"1\"});\nthis.$db.newEntity({schema:User, data:{ id:'1', profile:profileRecord }});\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Profile } from \"../profile.js\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nvar profileRecord = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:Profile, pK:\"1\"});\nvar userRecord = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\nuserRecord.$.set(\"profile\", profileRecord);\n```\nRelation Array Utils\nadd\n\nTo add a new relation data to a Many relation, add method over that particular Many relation array can be used as shown in the example below,\n\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../../data-store/schemas/blog.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:Blog, pK:\"1\"});\nblog.tags.add(\"2\");\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../../data-store/schemas/blog.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:Blog, pK:\"1\"});\nblog.tags.add({id:'3'});\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../../data-store/schemas/blog.js\";\nimport { Tag } from \"../../data-store/schemas/tag.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:Blog, pK:\"1\"});\nvar tagRecord = this.$db.cache.getEntity({Tag, pK:\"1\"});\nblog.tags.add(tagRecord);\n```\nremove\n\nTo remove a related entity from a Many relation, remove method over that particular Many relation array can be used as shown in the example below,\n\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../../data-store/schemas/blog.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:Blog, pK:\"1\"});\nblog.tags.remove(\"2\");\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../../data-store/schemas/blog.js\";\nimport { Tag } from \"../../data-store/schemas/tag.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:Blog, pK:\"1\"});\nvar tagRecord = this.$db.cache.getEntity({Tag, pK:\"4\"});\nblog.tags.remove(tagRecord);\n```\n\nNote : this.$app.arrayUtils is not synced with store's Many relation array. If it is used in a entity, entity will not be get dirty.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 31,
    "content": "Manipulating Data\nFetch Data\n\nTo fetch data from the server, getAll / getEntity method of db can be used. This will make an API request based on the connecter configuration defined in the db. Once the request is successful and data will be cached as entity objects in that specific schema.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getAll({schema:User}).then( function(data){\n  console.log( data );\n},function(){\n    console.log(\"failure callback\");\n});  // => GET '/user'\n```\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"}).then( function(data){\n  console.log( data );\n},function(){\n    console.log(\"failure callback\");\n});  // => GET '/user/1' return Promise\n```\n\nTo know more about it, please visit querying data.\n\nCreate Data\n\nCreating a data in a schema is nothing but creating an entity. Data can be of two types namely persistent data and non-persistant data. Let us see the ways to create them.\n\nCreating persistant data\n\nIn simple terms, persistent data is the data present in the server. This data can be fetched using the utils like getEntity and getAll. Creating a persistent data can be done using the method push\n\nPush\n\nEntity data from the server can be pushed as a persisted entity in schema.\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.push({ schema:User , data:{ id : \"1\" , name : \"john\" , mail : \"a@a.com\" }});\n```\n\nCreating non persistant data\n\nCreate newEntity\n\nNew entity can be created using newEntity method. Data object can be passed to it, else an empty entity object will be created. Entity will be validated by default during this method. State of this entity will be Isnew.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.newEntity({ schema:User , data:{ id : \"1\" , name : \"john\" , mail : \"a@a.com\" }});\n```\n\nNow let us see how to create a non-persistent data with skipValidation.\n\nnewEntity with skipValidation\n\nNew entity can be created with skipValidation option. Just set the skipValidation property as true. You can provide validation while saving the entity.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.newEntity({ schema:User , data:{ id : \"1\" , name : \"john\" , mail : \"a@a.com\" }, skipValidation: true});\n```\nGet Data from Cached Data Store\ncache.getAll\n\nYou can use cache.getAll to fetch all the data of a specified schema. It returns an array of entity in the schema.\n\nFor example, you can fetch data from the 'user' model using cache.getAll as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.cache.getAll({ schema:User });\n```\n\nNote: This will have a live reference to the user schema's data. Any changes done to the user schema will also be reflected in the respective entity.\n\nTo filter the entities with some values, the array's filter method can be used.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar data = this.$db.cache.getAll({ schema:User }).filter( function( itm ){\n    return itm.company == \"zoho\";\n});\n```\ncache.getEntity\n\nYou can use cache.getEntity to get a cached entity of the specified schema. However, this will not send any requests to the server.\n\nFor example, you can use this.$db.cache.getEntity to fetch a cached entity from the 'user' schema as follows:\n\nprimaryKey\n\nFor primaryKey, pK value can be passed as string / number in the specific pK key of the getEntity.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:User , pK:'1' });\n```\ncompositeKey\n\nFor compositeKey, pK value can be passed as an object, with specific composite key values in it.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:User , pK: {id:'1', type:'admin'} });\n```\nUpdating an Entity\n\nEntity's properties can be updated using set method of entity.$. During this set, the value will be validated. If the validation fails, the error data will be set in entity.$.error with entity.$.isError set to true.\n\nHead to error handling section to learn more about it.\n\nsingle data set\n\nTo set a single property in a entity, pass prop name as the first param and value as second param to entity.$.set.\n\n```javascript\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.set( \"name\" , \"max\" );\n```\nmultiple data set\n\nMultiple properties can also be set to a entity, when it is passed as an object to entity.$.set.\n\n```javascript\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.set({ name : \"max\" , mail : \"b@b.com\" });\n```\n\nNote: If a property of a entity is set without using entity.$.set, then entity's state or DOM bindings will not be affected. Always use any data set utils to set a value\n\nDeleting an Entity\n\nEntity can be deleted using entity.$.delete method. This will delete the entity from the schema. In order to make the entity data persistent, by sending a request to the server, that entity has to be saved.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema: User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.delete();\n```\ndestroy\n\nentity.$.destroy can be used to delete a entity from the db and make a request for the same.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema: User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.destroy().then( function(){\n  //Success callback\n},function(){\n  // Failure callback\n});\n```\nwith delayPersistence\n\nWhen deleting a entity with delayPersistence as true, that entity will be removed from the schema's data/relation's data only when that entity's delete is persisted(saved successfully) to the server. Below are the ways in which delayPersistence can be used,\n\nTo enable delayPersistence for all the entity in db, provide the following option in the application connector,\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTConnector } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass ApplicationConnector extends RESTConnector{\n  delayPersistence = {delete: true};\n}\nexport { ApplicationConnector };\n```\n\nTo enable delayPersistence for all the model records, please provide the following option in the specific adapter,\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationConnector } from \"./application\";\nclass UserConnector extends ApplicationConnector{\n    delayPersistence = {delete: true};\n}\nexport { UserConnector };\n```\n\nTo enable delayPersistence for a particular entity, please provide the following option in the entity's delete / destroy,\n\n```javascript\nentity.$.delete(true);\n```\n```javascript\nentity.$.destroy({},{},true);\n```\nRevert\n\nEntity's properties values can be reverted to its initial values using revert method in entity.\n\nrevert an entity\n\nWhile doing the revert, only the particular entity's change that is done via the entity will be reverted and the related entity's remains unaffected for the revert.\n\nLet us see the following methods to be implemented while reverting an entity\n\nNewEntity(Entity.$.IsNew)\n\nIf the state of entity that is being reverted is IsNew, then the entity gets dropped from the db's schema data.\n\nDeletedEntity(Entity.$.IsDeleted)\n\nIf the state of entity that is being reverted is IsDeleted,then the entity gets added back to db's schema data.\n\nModified Entity\n\nIf the state of the entity that is being reverted is IsModified, then the entity's changed properties will be reverted to its intial value.\n\nYou can also change the entity's changed properties to be reverted to its initial value. Have a look at the below code snippet to understand how it is done.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.revert();\n```\nrevert a prop\n\nA specific prop value can be reverted using entity.$.revertProps()\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.revertProps( \"name\" );\n```\n\nNote: By passing array of attributes, you can revert more than one attribute too.\n\nTo revert all the entity in a schema, revert method in the db can be used.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.revert({schema:User});\n```\nrevert all entity in a schema\n\nTo revert all the entity in a schema, revert method in the db can be used.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.revert({schema:User});\n```\nrevert to a state\n\nIn order to revert the entity to a specific state of the entity, this option can be used. A state can be saved to a entity at a specific point, which can be used to revert the entity to that specific state.\n\nConsider the following changes done to the entity initially,\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema: User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.set ( \"username\" , \"changed1\" );\nentity.$.set ( \"email\" , \"test@mail.com\" );\nentity.$.set ( \"phone\" , \"1111111111\" );\n```\n\nState of the entity can be saved as follows.\n\n```javascript\nentity.$.saveState ( \"test\" );\n//[ OR ]\nentity.$.saveState (); // Which returns a state name.\n```\n\nThen considering the following changes are done to the entity,\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.set ( \"username\" , \"changed2\" );\nentity.$.set ( \"email\" , \"nottest@mail.com\" );\nentity.$.set ( \"phone\" , \"2222222222\" );\n```\n\nTo revert to the specific state of the entity, state name can be passed to revert method as follows\n\n```javascript\nentity.$.revert ( \"test\" );\n// now entity will have values { username : 'changed1' , email : 'test@mail.com' , phone : '1111111111' }\n```\nDrop\ndrop an entity\n\nTo remove a entity of the schema from db, dropEntity method can be used.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.dropEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\n```\ndrop all entity\n\nTo remove all entity of the schema from store, dropAll can be used.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.dropAll({schema:User, pK:\"1\"});\n```\ndrop array of entity\n\nTo remove an array of entity from the schema, pass the array of entity to dropAll method in store.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar data = this.$db.cache.getAll({schema:User}).filter( function( itm ){\n  return itm.company == \"zoho\";\n});\nthis.$db.dropAll({schema: User, data:data});\n```\nUndo or Redo\n\nThe changes that are made to the entity can be undone/redone using the method undo/redo in the entity respectively.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema: User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.set ( \"username\" , \"peter\" );\nentity.$.undo(); // Now the username value will be john\nentity.$.redo(); // Now the username value will be peter\nentity.$.set ({ \"username\" : \"albert\" , \"phone\" : \"333\" });\nentity.$.undo(); // Now the username will be peter and phone will be 111\n```\n\nNote: Last operation that is done on the particular record will only be undone / redone\n\nUndo or Redo Props\n\nTo undo/redo a specific prop of entity, pass the props name to the undo/redo method of the entity.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema: User, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.set ( { \"username\" : \"peter\" , \"phone\" : \"222\" } );\nentity.$.undo(\"username\"); // Now the username value will be john\n// [ OR ]\nentity.$.undo ( [ \"username\" , \"phone\" ] ); // Now the username value will be john and phone will be 111\nentity.$.redo(); // Now the username value will be peter\n// [ OR ]\nentity.$.undo ( [ \"username\" , \"phone\" ] ); //Now the username will be peter and phone will be 222\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

  "https://slyte.csez.zohocorpin.com/1.0.4/doc/data/query-data": {
    "order": 32,
    "content": "Querying Data\n\nsLyte lets you to perform query actions on the entity in your application with much ease. Besides,you can also fetch data from the server, get the cached data from the db, sort entities based on a given property, and more.\n\nNote: When the data is inserted to db via get / push, validation won't happen. Since the data is fetched from the server it will be considered as a persisted data. Validation will happen only when the data is changed in the client through entity.$.set\n\nFetching Data from Server\ngetAll\n\nWith getALL, a GET request will be sent to the server to fetch data for the specified entity. This returns a promise object which is used to handle both success and failure callback. In short, getAll is used to retrieve all the entities of the specified schema.\n\nFor example, you can obtain all the entities of the user schema from the server in the following way:\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getAll({schema:User}).then( function(data){\n  console.log( data );\n},function(){\n    console.log(\"failure callback\");\n});  // => GET '/user'\n// Note: this doesn't have a live reference to user schema. Any changes done to user schema will not be reflected to this array. To obtain live reference use this.$db.cache.getAll as shown below.\n```\nget an entity\n\nTo get a specific entity, you can use getEntity request. It lets you to retrieve the data of the specified schema for the primary key. You can use this.$db.getEntity with pK value option. This also returns a promise object which is used to handle both the success and the failure functions.\nFor example, you can retrieve the entity of a single user with a specific pK in the following manner:\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\"}).then( function(data){\n  console.log( data );\n},function(){\n    console.log(\"failure callback\");\n});  // => GET '/user/1' return Promise\n```\nwith queryParams\n\nsLyte also lets you pass the query params for each request. You can use this.$db.get with query parameters for each request. You can pass these query parameters, in the qP option of the respective request, which will be sent as the GET request's parameters.\n\nHave a look at the below code to see how it works.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getAll({schema:User, qP:{ name : \"test\" , email : \"test@zohocorp.com\" }});\n```\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"1\", qP:{ name : \"test\" , email : \"test@zohocorp.com\" }});\n```\nHandling Metadata\n\nAny additional information regarding the request will be received as metadata.\nPagination is a common example of using metadata. Imagine a blog with far more posts than you can display at once. You might query it like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getAll({schema: User, qP: {\n  \"limit\" : 10,\n  pageNo : 1\n}});   // => GET '/user?limit=10&pageNo=1'\n```\n\nTo get different pages of data, you'd simply change your pageNo in increments of 10. Similarly server can also send meta information for a particular request, example total record count can be received from the server.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"post\" : {\n    \"id\" : '1',\n    \"title\" : \"Test blog\",\n    \"comments\" : [ \"1\" , \"2\" ]\n  },\n  \"meta\" : {\n    \"total\" : 100\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis meta information can be retrieved like this:\n\n```javascript\nimport { PostSchema } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getAll({schema: PostSchema}).then( function(data ){\n  console.log( data.$.meta );\n});\nthis.$db.getEntity({schema: PostSchema, pK: \"1\"}).then( function( data )){\n  console.log( data.$.meta );\n});\n```\n\nNote: For single entity get, the entity object will hold the recent meta information that is received from the server in entity.$.meta . However for multiple data get, the meta data will be available only in the data that is received in success callback.\n\nCaching and Preventing Duplicate Request\ncaching with queryParams\n\ndb lets you cache the data with its corresponding query parameters. Once a query parameter is cached, consecutive requests with the same query parameters will not be sent to the server. To fetch data from the server forcefully with the same query parameters, you should clear the cache just like the below code snippet\n\nNote: To cache the data of the requests which don't have query parameters, you can use refetchAll and refetchEntity connector callback for this.$db.get and this.$db.get a entity queries respectively.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getAll({ schema:User , qP:{ name : \"test\" }, cacheQuery:true});\nthis.$db.getAll({ schema:User , qP:{ name : \"test\" }});                  // No request will be sent\nthis.$db.clearCachedQuery({ schema:User , qP:{ name : \"test\" }});         // Will clear the cache\nthis.$db.getAll({ schema:User , qP:{ name : \"test\" } , cacheQuery:true});            // => GET '/user?name=test'\nthis.$db.getAll({ schema:User , qP:{ name : \"test\" } , cacheQuery:false ,cacheData:false }); // => GET '/user?name=test' Note: The retrieved data will not be saved in this.$db.\n```\n\nNote: To clear the cached queries, use clearCachedQuery as shown above in the example.\n\nwith custom cacheQuery\n\ndb lets you cache the data with its corresponding cacheQuery param. Once a valid cacheQuery is passed, consecutive requests with the same cacheQuery will not be sent to the server. To fetch data from the server forcefully with the same query parameters, you should clear the cache in the following manner and make the request.\n\nNote: queryParams will not be checked, if a custom cacheQuery is passed.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.getAll({ schema:User, qP:{}, cacheQuery:\"test\"}); // => GET '/user?name=test'\nthis.$db.getAll({ schema:User, qP:{}, cacheQuery:\"test\"}); // No request will be sent\nthis.$db.getAll({ schema:User, qP:{test:'test'}, cacheQuery:\"test\"}); // No request will be sent\nthis.$db.clearCachedQuery({ schema:User , cacheQuery:\"test\"}); // Will clear the cache\n```\n\nNote: To clear the cached queries, use clearCachedQuery as shown above in the example.\n\ncacheData option\n\nBy default, all the data received from the getAll / getEntity requests will be saved in the data store. In case you don't want to store the data, set the cacheData param as 'false' as shown.\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.getAll({ schema:User , qP:{ name : \"test\" } , cacheQuery:false ,cacheData:false }); // => GET '/user?name=test' Note: The retrieved data will not be saved in this.$db.\n```\ntrue (default)\n\nBy default, cacheData will be true. In that case, all the data received from the getAll / getEntity requests will be saved in the db as entities\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.getAll({schema: User});\n```\n```javascript\nthis.$db.getEntity({schema: User, pK: \"1\"});\n```\nfalse\n\nIn case you don't want to store the data in the db, set the cacheData param as 'false' as shown. During this option, normalize callbacks in serializer( normalizePayload, processEntity, normalizeEntity, normalizeKey ) will also be called.\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.getAll({schema: User, cacheData: false});\n```\n```javascript\nthis.$db.getEntity({schema: User, pK: \"1\", cacheData: false});\n```\noptional normalize\n\nIn case you don't want the normalize callbacks to be called during caching of data, pass normalize as 'false' to cacheData param as shown in the example. During this option with noramlize as false, normalize callbacks in serializer( normalizePayload, processEntity, normalizeEntity, normalizeKey ) will not be called during getAll / getEntity.\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.getAll({schema: User, cacheData: { cache:false, normalize:false }});\n```\n```javascript\nthis.$db.getEntity({schema: User, pK: \"1\", cacheData: { cache:false, normalize:false}});\n```\nreturn cachedData on subsequent getAll/getEntity using refetch callback\n\nrefetchAll and refetchEntity connector callbacks can be used to return cachedData by returning false. By returning true, request will be made to fetch the data.\n\n```javascript\nrefetchAll({ cachedData }){\n  if( cachedData.length == 100 ){\n    return false;\n  }\n  return true;\n}\n```\n```javascript\nrefetchEntity({ cachedData, queryParams }){\n  if( cachedData.isUptoDate ){\n    return false;\n  }\n  return true ;\n}\n```\nmapBy\n\nThe mapBy method retrieves the specified property from all the entity in the schema data array, and returns a new entity array. This can be used only for a entity array, such as with cache.getAll or related hasMany array. And it follows this syntax, RecordsArray.mapBy(<<field>>)\n\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.cache.getAll({ schema:User }).mapBy( \"username\" );\nthis.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:User, pK: \"1\" }).blog.mapBy( \"blog-name\" );\n```\nsortBy\n\nThe sortBy method sorts the entity array based on the specified property and returns a new entity array. This can also be used only in the entity array, such as with cache.getAll or hasMany record. And it has the following syntax, RecordsArray.sortBy(<<field>>,<<order>>)\n\n\nBy default, it sorts the entity in an ascending order. To sort them in a descending order, set the value of order as 'desc'.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nthis.$db.cache.getAll({ schema:User }).sortBy( \"username\" );\nthis.$db.cache.getAll({ schema:User }).sortBy( \"username\" , \"desc\" );\nthis.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:User, pK:\"1\" }).blog.sortBy( \"blog-name\" );\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

It defines how the related records should be sent to the server in the request. You have multiple options like null, partial, id, record to make it more interesting. Have a look at the below code snippet to get a better understanding of it.\n\nnull\n\nThis is the default option for serialize. No data will be sent for the relation.\n\nid\n\nOnly the primary key value of the related record will be sent to server.\n\npartial\n\nFor the above two cases, either the array of primary key values or array of record objects will be sent to server, irrespective of any changes that you have made to the records. Data store goes a step ahead and gives you an option, named as partial where you can send only the changed data to the server.\n\nFor Many relation, only the added/removed/modified related data will be sent to server instead of its entire data.\nFor one relation, if the record is modified, only the modified related data will be sent to server.\n\nFor every object in many/one partial related payload, there will be a property '$' which can have the below values depending on the case\n\nPartial has the following values in it.\n\nadded - contains the details of newly created record.\nmodified - any properties changes to the already related record\nremoved - related record is removed\nrelated - saved record is related\npolymorphicType - model name of the polymorphic record in relation\npk - primary key value of the record\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../comment.js\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      comments : many( Comment, { serialize: \"record\"}),\n      user: one( User, { serialize: \"record\"})\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Comment extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      blog : one( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Comment };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      username : prop( \"string\" ),\n      blog : one( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nFor the above model definition, consider a blog record with 10 comments and a user, below is how the related data will be sent for partial changes when the serialize is partial,\n\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema: Blog, pK:\"1\" });\nblog.comments.add({ desc : \"comment11\" }); // adding a new comment\nblog.comments.remove( \"1\" );              // removing a comment from blog\nblog.user.$.set( \"name\" , \"john\" );\nblog.$.save();\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog:{\n    id : \"1\",\n    user:{\n      id : \"1\",\n      name : \"john \"\n    },\n    comments:[{\n      desc : \"comment11\",\n      $:{\n        partialType : \"added\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"2\",\n      $:{\n        partialType : \"removed\"\n      }\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog : {\n    id : \"1\",\n    comments : [{\n      id : \"11\",\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: '$' key given in the payload(request data) will not be sent to server. It is an additional information for the partial records. It can be used in serializer callbacks to check and add/remove any keys as expected by the server.\n\nNote: Primary key value will be expected for newly created records. It should be in the same order as in payload (like it is sent to server). Additional data can also be given in the response, which will be merged with the record.\n\nrecord\n\nThe entire related record object will be sent to server.\nWith many, an array of related record will be sent with the payload and with one, related record object will be sent with the payload\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../comment.js\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      comments : many( Comment, {serializer: \"record\"} ),\n      user : one( User, {serialize:\"record\"})\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\n\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Comment extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      desc : prop( \"string\" ),\n      blog : one( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Comment };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      email : prop( \"string\" ),\n      phone : prop( \"number\" ),\n      blog : one(blog)\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nFor the above model definition, consider a blog record with 10 comments and a user, below is how the related data will be sent for partial changes when the serialize is record,\n\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:Blog, pK:\"1\" });\nblog.comments.add({ desc : \"comment11\" }); // adding a new comment\nblog.comments.remove( \"1\" );               // removing a comment from blog\nblog.user.$.set( \"name\" , \"john\" );\nblog.$.save();\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog : {\n    id : \"1\",\n    user : {\n      id : \"1\",\n      name : \"john \"\n    },\n    comments : [\n    {\n      id : \"2\",\n      desc : \"comment2\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"3\",\n      desc : \"comment3\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"4\",\n      desc : \"comment4\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"5\",\n      desc : \"comment5\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"6\",\n      desc : \"comment6\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"7\",\n      desc : \"comment7\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"8\",\n      desc : \"comment8\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"9\",\n      desc : \"comment9\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"10\",\n      desc : \"comment10\",\n    },\n    {\n      desc : \"comment11\"\n    }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog : {\n    id : \"1\",\n    comments : [\n    { id : \"2\" },\n    { id : \"3\" },\n    { id : \"4\" },\n    { id : \"5\" },\n    { id : \"6\" },\n    { id : \"7\" },\n    { id : \"8\" },\n    { id : \"9\" },\n    { id : \"10\" },\n    { id : \"11\" }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\ndeepNest\n\nBy default, data store, only tracks the changes made to that particular record using record.$.set / relation.add / relation.remove. For tracking any changes made to the related record directly or if n level of relations has to be listened, \"deepNest\" options has to be given to all those levels of relation.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../comment.js\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      comments : many( Comment, {serialize: \"partial\", deepNest : true} ),\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nimport { Tag } from \"../tag.js\";\nclass Comment extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      desc : prop( \"string\" ),\n      tags : many( Tag, { serialize: \"partial\", deepNest: true}),\n      blog: one( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Comment };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Tag extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      tagName : prop( \"string\" ),\n      comment : one(Comment)\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Tag };\n```\n\nAs per the above example, If there is any change in tag record, on saving blog record, tag data will be sent to server. Following will be the payload structure that will be sent to server.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({ Schema:Blog, pK:\"1\" });\nvar comment = blog.comments[0];\nvar tag = comment.tags[0];\ntag.$.set( \"tagName\" , \"tag11\" );\nblog.$.save();\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog : {\n    id : \"1\",\n    comments : [{\n      id : \"1\",\n      tags : [{\n        id : \"1\",\n        tagName : \"tag11\",\n        $ : {\n          type : \"modified\"\n        }\n      }]\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above payLoad, '$' property in the comments object will not be sent to the server ( since it is a non-iteratable property). It can be used to find the specific case and add / modify anything that is required by the server.\n\nThis will be received in serializer callbacks,which can be altered to meet the expectations of the server.\n\nNote: Partial success of the request is not supported. Response and record state will not be changed properly in that case.\n\nBatch Requests\n\nA batch request consists of multiple API calls bundled into one request. It is as simple as encapsulating your requests within a function call, and db takes care of bundling the requests and resolving the responses properly.\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.batch( function(){\n  this.$db.getAll({schema:LeadsSchema});\n  var entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema:\"Accounts\" , pK:\"1\"});\n  entity.$.set( \"email\" , \"test@zoho.com\" );\n  entity.$.save();\n  entity.$.triggerAction( \"sendEmail\" );\n});\n```\n\nBy default, the request will be sent to /batch/ url. Request data will be sent as an object by default with key as \"batch_requests\", with value as an array of all the requests made inside batch. Each request will have method, uri, content, parameters (queryParams) depends on the request.\nThe response will be expected as an object with key batch_request and value as the array of responses respective to each request sent.\nCheck the sample request and response below.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  batch_requests : [{\n    uri : \"v2/leads\",\n    method : \"GET\"\n  },\n  {\n    uri : \"v2/Accounts/1\",\n    method : \"PATCH\",\n    content : {\n      Accounts : {\n        id : '1',\n        email : 'test@zoho.com'\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    uri : \"v2/Accounts/1/action/sendEmail\",\n    method : \"POST\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n```javascript\n// response with success code 2**\n{\n  batch_requests : [{\n    leads : [{\n      id : '1',\n      name : 'test1'\n    },\n    {\n      id : '2',\n      name : 'test2'\n    }]\n  },\n  {\n    Accounts : {\n      id : '1',\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\nSaving Multiple Entities\n\nMultiple created records/deleted records/modified records can be sent to server in a single request via following.\n\ncreate\n\nTo send a request for all created records, db.create method is used. This will send a POST request, with all created records payload in the request data.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schema/user\";\nthis.$db.create({schema:User}).then(function(){\n  // Success callback\n},function(){\n  // Failure callback\n});\n```\n\nNote: Response data should be in the same order as the request data, in order for the store to merge it with model's data.\n\nupdate\n\nTo send a request for all modified records, db.update method is used. This will send a PATCH request, with all updated records payload in the request data.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schema/user\";\nthis.$db.update({schema:User}).then(function(){\n  // Success callback\n},function(){\n  // Failure callback\n});\n```\ndelete\n\nTo send a request for all deleted records, db.delete method is used. This will send a DELETE request, with all deleted records id in the request data.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schema/user\";\nthis.$db.delete({schema:User}).then(function(){\n  // Success callback\n},function(){\n  // Failure callback\n});\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 34,
    "content": "Schemas\nSchema\n\nAs mentioned in the datastore, schema is the blueprint of the data and it defines the data's properties and relations, similar to defining a table in MySQL.\n\n\nYou can define and register a schema just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(app){\n    return{\n\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nSkeleton\n\nA sample schema is being presented here for your reference.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { UserConnector } from \"../connectors/user\";\nimport { UserSerializer } from \"../serializer/user\";\nimport { Profile } from \"./profile\";\nimport { TestValidator } from \"../../validators/custom\";\nimport { email } from \"../data-types/email\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n    static Connector = UserConnector;\n    static Serializer = UserSerializer;\n\tprops(app){\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tstr: prop(\"string\"),\n\t\t\tcustom: prop(email),\n\t\t\tvalidate: prop(\"string\", {validation: TestValidator}),\n\t\t\tprofiles: many(Profile),\n\t\t\tcurrentProfile: one(Profile)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tdidLoad(){\n\t}\n\tactions(){\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\"convert\" : { endPoint: \"crmConvert\" }\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tstatic observers(){\n\t\treturn { obs1:function(){}.observes(\"str\") }\n   \t}\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nNaming\n\nValid class name can be a schema name. It is recommended to start the name of the schema in capital letter.\n\nHere is a list of few component names for your reference.\n\nValid schema names.\nUser\nProfile_User\nBlog\n\nInvalid schema names.\nprofile-user\n1user\nprofile#user\n\nGenerate using CLI\n\nTo generate a schema using CLI, use the following command. It will create schema file under data-store/schemas folder.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate schema User\n```\n\nThe CLI will automatically add Schema.register() during the compilation. For any dynamic schema registration, register schema just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n\tprops(){\n\t}\n}\nUser.register();\n```\nDefining Props\n\nProps is a method in schema which should return a list of all the properties of the schema in an object structure. Defined props will be validated whenever the data is set / changed in the entity. Entity can hold the properties that are not defined in schema too. When the entity is serialized, only the defined properties will be serialized and sent as payload by default.\n\nNote: During the getAll/ getEntity/ push, props will not validated, since the data will be considered as a proper data from the server. So it is recommended to have the props in sync with your API structure.\n\nApp instance will be passed as an argument to props method as below,\n\n```javascript\nprops(app){\n  return {\n\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFollowing are the different props that can be defined.\n\nStatic Props\n\nAttributes represent the properties of a schema, similar to how fields represent the columns of a table. You can create an attribute by defining the Attribute name, Data type, and optional constraints called Options.\n\nThe syntax for defining an attribute is:\n\n```javascript\n//import prop from lyte-util.js\nAttributeName : prop( dataType , { options });\n```\n\nPrimitive data types:\n\nstring\nnumber\nboolean\nobject\narray\n\nDynamic Props\n\nOther than the schema definition, field can also be added dynamically.\n```javascript\ndb.addField({schema, key, prop, skipValidation, deserialize});\n(or)\ndb.addField({schema, key, type, options, skipValidation, deserialize})\n```\nBy default, the added property will be validated with the added field configurations in all the entities of the schema. However, you can ignore the validation during addField, by specifying ignoreValidation option as true.\n\nTo call deserialize for customDataType, pass deserialize option as true in the syntax as below\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.addField({schema:User, key:\"username\", type:\"string\", options:{ mandatory : true });\nthis.$db.addField({schema:User, key:\"username\", prop:prop(\"string\",{ mandatory : true }));\nthis.$db.addField({schema:User, key:\"username\",  type:\"string\", options:{ mandatory : true }, skipValidation:true});\n```\n\nNote: If a prop is added again, it will replace the old prop definition.\n\nCustom Data Type\n\nTo create custom data type using CLI, use the following command. It will create file under data-store/data-types folder.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate data-type dollars\n```\n\nIn addition to the primitive data types, you can define a custom data type and use it in a schema as shown below in the example. This custom data type should be the extended one of the predefined primitive data types.\n\nA custom data type has two methods:\n\nSerialize and\nDeserialize\n\nSerialize can be used to serialize the value of a prop to the format expected by the server arguments - data, key, record\n\nDeserialize can be used to deserialize the value of a prop to a format that the client expects. arguments - data, key, model, pkVal\n\nFor example, you can define a custom data type 'dollars' as an extension of the primitive data type 'number' as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { DataType } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass Dollars extends DataType{\n  static type = \"string\"\n  static serialize(deserialized, key, record){\n      return deserialized * 70 ;\n  }\n  static deserialize(serialized, key, modelName, pkVal){\n      return serialized / 70 ;\n  }\n}\nexport { Dollars };\n```\n\nCustom data type can be imported and used in the schema like below,\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb  } from \"../db\";\n import { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\n import { Dollars } from \"../data-types/dollars\";\n class User extends Schema{\n   props(){\n     return {\n       spent: prop(Dollars)\n     }\n   }\n }\n export { User };\n```\n\nBefore setting a value, it will be validated against the specified constraints.\nIf satisfied the data will be stored, otherwise an error object will be returned. Apart from the available constraints, custom validators can also be added.\nNote: The datas received from the server will be inserted without validating.\n\nNote: For primitive or custom data types, data received from the server will be inserted without any validation.\n\nnested property definition\nobject\n\nThe data type can also be customised even for the nested object. It can be defined as follows.\n\n```javascript\nLyte.registerDataType(\"newobj\" , {\n  extends : \"object\",\n  properties : {\n      obj1: Lyte.attr(\"object\" , {\n          properties : {\n              a : Lyte.attr(\"string\"),\n              b : Lyte.attr(\"number\"),\n              c : Lyte.attr(\"string\")\n          }\n      }),\n      arr1 : Lyte.attr(\"array\",{\n          items : Lyte.attr(\"string\")\n      })\n  }\n})\n```\n\nIn the above code, 'obj1' is nested inside the object 'newobj'. And the datatypes for the key 'a', 'b' and 'c' is defined as string, number and string.\n\narray\n\nThe datatype can also be customised for the nested arrays and it can be defined as follows.\n\n```javascript\nLyte.registerDataType(\"newArr\", {\n    extends : \"array\",\n    items:Lyte.attr(\"object\",{\n        properties : {\n            a: Lyte.attr(\"string\")\n        }\n    })\n})\n```\nRelationships\n\nYou can also define how a schema is related to another through relationships. Below are the supported relationships in db.\n\n\none to one\none to many\nmany to one\nmany to many\n\nNote: By default, relationships can either be one-way or two-way. It can be defined alteast in anyone of the schemas.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { User } from \"./user.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id: prop(\"string\"),\n      description: prop(\"string\"),\n      bloggers: many(User)\n    };\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"./blog.js\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n        id : prop( \"string\" ),\n        journal : one( Blog )\n    };\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nNote: Relationship attribute name need not be same as that of the related schema.\n\nProp Options\n\nprop is a util from \"@slyte/core\" package, which can be used to define a static prop for a schema. Syntax of prop is,\n\n```javascript\nprop(type, options)\n```\n\nIn the above syntax, options is an object. Following are the different options that can be used in props util\n\nPrimary key\n\nPrimary key is the unique identifier of schema. By default, the 'id' prop will be considered as the primary key. Other property can also be made as a primary key, by giving primaryKey as true in options while defining attribute.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      hashKey : prop( \"string\", { primaryKey : true } ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nNote: Only the attribute of type 'string' or 'number' can be made as primary key.\n\nComposite key\n\nComposite key is the combination of two or more keys that can uniquely identify an entity in the schema. Definition is more like the primary key, where here the primaryKey option can be given in more than one attribute.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      email : prop( \"string\", { primaryKey : true } ),\n      id : prop(\"string\", { primaryKey : true, baseKey : true}),\n      name : prop( \"string\" )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nNote: In case of composite keys, the property with baseKey option will be used as the primary key value in the url, when a entity is being saved or deleted. It can be added as shown above in the example. In the absence of baseKey, the composite key values will be given in the request data.\n\nDefault Patterns\n\nA pattern is a type of option that is used to perform validation checks for an attribute. It specifies the characters that are allowed to be used in the value of an attribute that is assigned to that particular pattern.\n\nFor example, an email pattern specifies the characters that are permitted to be used for an email address attribute, and defines the standard format of an email address. If a value for the attribute does not satisfy this constraint, an error message will appear. There are two kinds of patterns:\n\nThere are some default patterns that are available in sLyte. It is available in the \"patterns\" property in the app / addon instance. The permitted characters and the standard format for each default pattern are specified below:\n\nemail - /^([A-Za-z0-9._%\\-\\'\\+\\/]+@[A-Za-z0-9.\\-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,22})$|[\\s]+$/\nurl - /(^(ht|f)tp(s?)\\:\\/\\/[0-9a-zA-Z][-.\\w]*(:[0-9])*(\\/?)([a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\.\\?\\,\\:\\'\\/\\\\\\+=&%\\$#_\\[\\]@!\\(\\)\\*;~]*)?$)/\nam pm - /^(AM|PM|am|pm)$/\nhour - /^(0?[0-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-4])$/\nminute - /^(0?[0-9]|[1-5][0-9]|60)$/\nboolean - /^(true|false|TRUE|FALSE)$/\nalphaNumeric - /([a-zA-Z0-9])+/\nalphabetsOnly - /([a-zA-Z])+/\nnumeric - /([0-9])+/\nphoneNo - /^[0-9a-zA-Z\\+\\.\\(\\)\\-\\;\\s]+$/\n\n```javascript\nprop( \"string\" , { pattern: \"email\" });\n```\n\nLet's add another attribute 'email' for the schema 'user'. The 'email' attribute is defined with an option which specifies that the value for the email must follow the constraints of the email default pattern. This can be defined as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb } from \"../db\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(app){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      username : prop( \"string\" ),\n      phone : prop( \"number\" , { minimum : 10 }),\n      email : prop( \"string\" , { pattern : \"email\" }),\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nCustom Pattern\n\nApart from the default patterns, custom patterns can also be registered and used. A custom pattern is registered using registerPattern method in sLyte app instance. The syntax for defining a pattern is as follows:\n\n```javascript\nappInstance.registerPattern( \"moduleName\" , /CustomModule[1-5]/ );\n```\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb } from \"../db\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(app){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      username : prop( \"string\" ),\n      phone : prop( \"number\" , { minimum : 10 }),\n      email : prop( \"string\" , { pattern : \"email\" }),\n      module : prop( \"string\", { pattern : \"moduleName\"} )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nCustom Validator\n\nSometimes, a pattern or other default validators may not be sufficient to validate an attribute. In such case, a custom validator can be registered and used. A custom validator can be registered as follows,\n\n```javascript\nimport { CustomValidator } from \"@slyte/core/customValidator\";\nclass CheckLanguage extends CustomValidator{\n  validate(fieldName, fieldValue){\n    if( fieldValue.indexOf([ \"English\" , \"Tamil\" ]) != -1 ){\n      return true;\n    } else {\n      return { message : \"Unsupported Language\" }; // returning an object with key message would align with the default error message of the data store.\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { customValidator };\n```\n\nNow, let's use the custom validator checkLanguage in the schema 'user' for an prop 'language' which is of the data type 'string'. This can be done as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb } from \"../db\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { CheckLanguage } from \"../../validators/checkLanguage\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      username : prop( \"string\" ),\n      language : prop( \"string\" , { validation : CheckLanguage })\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nNote: In case of validation failure, either an object or a string can be returned. It is suggested to return the error message in an object with key message, so that it would align with the default error message of the data store.\n\nwatch\n\nWith the option watch as true in the object / array attribute, any changes made to any level in the object / array which are done using data set utils will be listened and the respective field will be made dirty in the record. Record's rollback / undo / redo can be done for these changes.\n\nIf a deepObserver ( field.* ) is given for the such attribute, the observer will be called for any deepChange in the array/object.\n\nConsidering a model with watch option as follows\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb } from \"../db\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      obj : prop ( \"object\" , { watch: true } ) ,\n      arr : prop ( \"array\" , { watch: true } ) ,\n    }\n  }\n  static observers(){\n    return {\n      obs1 : function(){\n\n      }.observes(\"obj.*\", \"arr.*\");\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nSetting a deep property in an object\n\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"../../components/component.js\";\nComponent.set ( rec.obj.obj1 , \"attr2\" , \"test2\" );\n```\n\nSetting a deep property in an array,\n\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"../../components/component.js\";\nComponent.set ( rec.arr[0].obj1 , \"attr2\" , \"test11\" );\n```\n\nUsing arrayUtils,\n\n```javascript\nimport { testApp } from \"../../app.js\";\ntestApp.arrayUtils ( rec.arr[0].obj1.arr1 , \"push\" , 4 );\n```\n\nAfter any one of the above cases, entity will be dirty. If a deep observer is defined, it will be called for the above statements.\n\nNote: Upon a entity save, if the object / array is dirty, the entire data of the object / array will only be sent in the request payLoad.\n\nOther Validation options\n\nOptional constraints called options can be set for an attribute based on its data type. The available options for an attribute are:\n\n\n\tSTRING\tNUMBER\tBOOLEAN\tARRAY\tOBJECT\nprimaryKey\t\t\t\t\t\ndefault\t\t\t\t\t\nmandatory\t\t\t\t\t\nmaximum\t\t\t\t\t\nminimum\t\t\t\t\t\nmaxLength\t\t\t\t\t\nminLength\t\t\t\t\t\nmaxItems\t\t\t\t\t\nminItems\t\t\t\t\t\nuniqueItems\t\t\t\t\t\npattern\t\t\t\t\t\nitems\t\t\t\t\t\nwatch\t\t\t\t\t\ninstanceof\t\t\t\t\t\n\nWhen you define options for an attribute, the value of the attribute will be validated against the specified constraints. The validation check will take place when you assign a value for the attribute. If the constraints are fulfilled, the data will be stored in the db. Otherwise, an error object will be returned. In addition to the available options, custom validators can also be added.\n\nRelation Options\n\n\"one\" and \"many\" are the utils from \"@slyte/core\" class. Following is the syntax of those,\n\n```javascript\none(SchemaClass, options)\n```\n```javascript\nmany(SchemaClass, options)\n```\n\nIn the above syntax, options is an object. Following are the different options that can be used in one / many util,\n\ninverse\n\nIf two schemas are related to each other more than once, you need to explicitly specify the attribute based on which they are related. For example, a blog can have both reviewers and collaborators as users. The schema 'blog' therefore has an explicit inverse relationship with the schema 'users' in this context. To define an explicit inverse relationship between two schemas, you can use the 'inverse' option in Many. Let's define the schema 'user' and the schema 'blog' with an explicit inverse relationship as follows:\n\nA blog has many users as reviewers.\nA blog has many users as collaborators\n\nNote: An explicit inverse relationship between two schemas can be specified in either of the schemas.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      reviewed_blogs : many( Blog , { inverse : \"reviewer\" }),\n      edited_blogs : many( Blog , { inverse : \"collaborator\" })\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { User } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      reviewer : many( User),\n      collaborator : many( User)\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n\nThe api response for blog api should be like this\n\n```javascript\n{\n  blogs : [{\n    id : \"8675309\",\n    name : \"Blog Title\",\n    reviewer : [{\n      id : \"user1\",\n      name : \"userName\",\n      phone : \"12345\",\n      _ type : \"admin\",   // This value will be recieved from the server OR computed in the serializer\n      permission : \"ALL\"\n    }],\n    collaborator : [{\n      id : \"user2\",\n      name : \"userName1\",\n      phone : \"123457\",\n      _ type : \"employee\",\n      designation : \"MTS\"\n    }]\n  }]\n}\n```\nserialize\n\nserialize is an option in the related attribute of the schema definition, to define how the related entity should be sent to the server in the request. It has the following options,\n\nnull\n\nThis is the default option for serialize. No data will be sent for the relation.\n\nid\n\nOnly the primary key value of the related entity will be sent to server.\n\nrecord\n\nThe entire related entity object will be sent to server.\nMany: array of related entity will be sent with the payload,\none: related entity object will be sent with the payload\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../comment.js\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      comments : many( Comment, {serialize: \"record\"} ),\n      user : one( User, {serialize:\"record\"})\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Comment extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      desc : prop( \"string\" ),\n      blog : one( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Comment };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      email : prop( \"string\" ),\n      phone : prop( \"number\" ),\n      blog : one(blogSchema)\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nFor the above model definition, consider a blog entity with 10 comments and 1 user, below is how the related data will be sent for partial changes when the serialize is record,\n\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:Blog, pK:\"1\" });\nblog.comments.add({ desc : \"comment11\" }); // adding a new comment\nblog.comments.remove( \"1\" );               // removing a comment from blog\nblog.user.$.set( \"name\" , \"john\" );\nblog.$.save();\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog : {\n    id : \"1\",\n    user : {\n      id : \"1\",\n      name : \"john \"\n    },\n    comments : [\n    {\n      id : \"2\",\n      desc : \"comment2\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"3\",\n      desc : \"comment3\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"4\",\n      desc : \"comment4\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"5\",\n      desc : \"comment5\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"6\",\n      desc : \"comment6\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"7\",\n      desc : \"comment7\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"8\",\n      desc : \"comment8\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"9\",\n      desc : \"comment9\",\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"10\",\n      desc : \"comment10\",\n    },\n    {\n      desc : \"comment11\"\n    }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog : {\n    id : \"1\",\n    comments : [\n    { id : \"2\" },\n    { id : \"3\" },\n    { id : \"4\" },\n    { id : \"5\" },\n    { id : \"6\" },\n    { id : \"7\" },\n    { id : \"8\" },\n    { id : \"9\" },\n    { id : \"10\" },\n    { id : \"11\" }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\npartial\n\nFor the above two cases, either the array of primary key values or array of entity objects will be sent to server, irrespective of the changes to only one or few of the entity. db provides an option called partial to send only the changed data to the server.\n\nFor many relation, only the added/removed/modified related data will be sent to server instead of its entire data.\nFor one relation, if the entity is modified, only the modified relation data will be sent to server.\n\nFor every object in many/one partial related payload, there will be a property '$' which can have the below values depending on the case\n\npartialType - it can have the following values.\nadded - newly created entity is related\nmodified - any properties changes to the already related entity\nremoved - related entity is removed\nrelated - saved entity is related\npolymorphicType - schema name of the polymorphic entity in relation.\npk - primary key value of the entity.\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../comment.js\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      comments : many( Comment, {serialize: \"partial\"} ),\n      user : one( User, {serialize:\"partial\"})\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Comment extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      desc : prop( \"string\" ),\n      blog : one( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Comment };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      email : prop( \"string\" ),\n      phone : prop( \"number\" ),\n      blog : one(blogSchema)\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nFor the above model definition, consider a blog entity with 10 comments and 1 user, below is how the related data will be sent for partial changes when the serialize is partial,\n\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:Blog, pK:\"1\" });\nblog.comments.add({ desc : \"comment11\" }); // adding a new comment\nblog.comments.remove( \"1\" );              // removing a comment from blog\nblog.user.$.set( \"name\" , \"john\" );\nblog.$.save();\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog:{\n    id : \"1\",\n    user:{\n      id : \"1\",\n      name : \"john \"\n    },\n    comments:[{\n      desc : \"comment11\",\n      $:{\n        partialType : \"added\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      id : \"2\",\n      $:{\n        partialType : \"removed\"\n      }\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog : {\n    id : \"1\",\n    comments : [{\n      id : \"11\",\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: '$' key given in the data. And this data is passed as an argument to the connector and the serializer. Have a look at the request data of the above code snippet to get a better understanding of it. This data will not be sent to server. It is an additional information for the partial entity. It can be used in serializer callbacks to check and add/remove any keys as expected by the server.\n\nNote: Primary key value will be expected for newly created records. It should be in the same order as in payload (like it is sent to server). Additional data can also be given in the response, which will be merged with the entity.\n\ndeepNest\n\nBy default, db only tracks the changes made to that particular entity using entity.$.set / relation.add / relation.remove. For tracking any changes made to the related entity directly or if n level of relations has to be listened, \"deepNest\" options has to be given to all those levels of relation.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../comment.js\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      comments : many( Comment, {serialize: \"partial\", deepNest : true} ),\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nimport { Tag } from \"../tag.js\";\nclass Comment extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      desc : prop( \"string\" ),\n      tags : many( Tag, { serialize: \"partial\", deepNest: true}),\n      blog: one( Blog )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Comment };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../blog.js\";\nclass Tag extends Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      tagName : prop( \"string\" ),\n      comment : one(Comment)\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Tag };\n```\n\nAs per the above example, If there is any change in tag entity, on saving blog entity, tag data will be sent to server. Following will be the payload structure (db property argument in the connector/ serilizer callback) that will be sent to server.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../blog.js\";\nvar blog = this.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:Blog, pK:\"1\" });\nvar comment = blog.comments[0];\nvar tag = comment.tags[0];\ntag.$.set( \"tagName\" , \"tag11\" );\nblog.$.save();\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  blog : {\n    id : \"1\",\n    comments : [{\n      id : \"1\",\n      tags : [{\n        id : \"1\",\n        tagName : \"tag11\",\n        $ : {\n          type : \"modified\"\n        }\n      }]\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above payLoad, '$' property in the comments object will not be sent to the server ( since it is a non-iteratable property). It can be used to find the specific case and add / modify anything that is required by the server.\n\nThis will be received in serializer callbacks, where it can be changed to how the server expects.\n\nNote: partial success of the request is not supported. Response and entity state will not be changed properly in that case.\n\ninherit\n\nWhenever an action such as toJSON / revert / drop is performed over an record, action won't be passed on to the relation / related records. With this inherit option as true, those actions can be inherited to the related records too.\n\n```javascript\nimport { appStore } from \"../store.js\";\nimport { prop, many, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { UserModel } from \"../user.js\";\nclass ProfileModel extends appDb.Model{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      user : one(UserModel, { inherit: true })\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { ProfileModel };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { appStore } from \"../store.js\";\nimport { attr } from \"@lyte/core/lyte-utils\";\nclass UserModel extends appDb.Model{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      username : prop( \"string\" ),\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { UserModel };\n```\ndidLoad\n\nBy default, datastore provides a didLoad callback, which will be called when a entity is inserted into the schema.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" )\n    }\n  }\n  didLoad(){\n\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nNote: 'this' context inside the didLoad callback will be the entity\n\nEndPoint\n\nEndPoint is the suffix to URI which will be added to the URL instead of Schema name. It will be declared in the schema definition as given below.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\n  class User extends Schema{\n    static endPoint = \"userDetails\";\n    props(){\n      // prop definitions\n    }\n  }\nUser.register();\n```\nObservers\n\nAn observer is a listener that watches a property for the occurence of a specified event and performs the required actions when the event occurs. The actions to be performed when the event occurs are defined in the form of a function in the observer's definition. Whenever the specified event occurs, the observer is automatically invoked and the defined actions are executed.\n\n\nDo check, for the types of observers. Instead of the component's data properties, properties defined in the model has to be used.\n\nLet's create the attributes 'firstname', 'lastname', 'amount', 'amountInDollar', and 'fullname' in the schema 'user'. The attribute 'fullname' is computed from 'first name' and 'last name', and the attribute 'amountInDollar' is computed from 'amount' using the observes function. Here, the attribute 'inDollar' will be invoked when the data is loaded from the server. We therefore use the on(\"init\") function. This can be done as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb } from \"../db\";\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Dollars } from \"../data-types/dollars\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n\tprops(){\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tid : prop( \"string\" ),\n\t\t\tfirstname : prop( \"string\" ),\n\t\t\tlastname : prop( \"string\" ),\n\t\t\tamount : prop( \"number\" ),\n\t\t\tamountInDollar : prop( \"number\" ),\n\t\t\tfullname : prop( \"string\" )\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\tstatic observers(){\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tobs1: function(){\n\t\t\t\tthis.$.set( \"fullname\" , this.firstname + \" \" + this.lastname ); // this represents record instance.\n\t\t\t}.observes(\"firstname\", \"lastname\"),\n\t\t\tobs2: function(){\n\t\t\t\tthis.$.set( \"currency\" , this.amount * 60 );\n\t\t\t}.observes(\"amount\")\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\nNote: Observers will be invoked when the values are set explicitly. By default, they will not be called if the data is loaded from the server. If you require an observer to be invoked when the data is loaded from the server, you should use the \"init\" function.\n\ndeprecateProps\n\nSchema props can be deprecated by defining those props like given below. To enable the deprecate option set deprecateModelFields as true\n\n```javascript\n//db.js\n class AppDb extends Db{\n    static deprecateProps = true; // deprecate option enalbled\n    lookups() {\n      return []\n  }\n}\n```\n\ndeprecateProps can be defined just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nclass user extends Schema{\n    static deprecateProps = [\"name\"];\n      props(){\n          return {\n              id: prop(\"string\"),\n              name : prop(\"string\")\n          }\n      }\n}\n```\nAction Handling\n\nIn some cases, you might need to accomplish certain tasks in your application, such as triggering an action on a entity. You can define custom actions and invoke them using the triggerAction method. Action will be configured as shown below.\n\nDefining action\n\nLet's define the actions 'sendMail' and 'convert' in the schema 'user'. They can be defined as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n\tactions(){\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tsendMail: { endPoint: \"send\" },\n\t\t\tconvert : {}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport { User };\n```\ntriggerAction in entity\n\nOnce the actions have been configured, you can use the triggerAction method to trigger the action, which will in turn instantiate a POST request to the server. The sendMail action is triggered as follows:\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar user = this.$db.getEntity({schema:User, pK:\"123\"});\nuser.$.triggerAction( \"sendMail\" , { \"version\" : \"1.2\" });           // => POST '/user/123/action/sendMail'\n```\ntriggerAction in schema\n```javascript\nthis.$db.triggerAction({schema:User , action:\"sendMail\" , qP:{ \"version\" : \"1.2\" });   => POST '/user/action/sendMail'\n```\n\nAlong with the Request Method, data for an action can also be passed as show in the example below.\n\n```javascript\nimport { User } from \"../../data-store/schemas/user\";\nvar user = this.$db.getEntity({schema: User, pK:\"123\"});\nuser.$.triggerAction( \"sendMail\" , { \"version\" : \"1.2\" }, {} , \"POST\" , { mailContent : 'hi, this is from sLyte team' });          // => POST '/user/123/action/sendMail'\n// OR\nthis.$db.triggerAction({schema:User , action:\"sendMail\" , qP:{ \"version\" : \"1.2\" }, method:\"POST\", data:{ mailContent : 'hi, this is from sLyte team' }});   => POST '/user/action/sendMail'\n```\nAdd a Prop Dynamically\n\nOther than the schema definition, field can also be added dynamically and the syntax is as follows:\n\ndb.addField({schema, key, prop, skipValidation, deserialize});\n\nYou can also use the following syntax.\n\ndb.addField({schema, key, type, options, skipValidation, deserialize});\n\nTo call deserialize for customDataType, pass deserialize option as true in the above syntax.\n\nBy default, the added property will be validated with the added field configurations in all the entities of the schema. However, you can ignore the validation during addField, by specifying ignoreValidation option as true.\n\nHave a look at the below code snippet, where a prop named as 'username' is added dynamically.\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.addField({schema:User, key:\"username\", type:\"string\", options:{ mandatory : true });\nthis.$db.addField({schema:User, key:\"username\", prop:prop(\"string\",{ mandatory : true }));\nthis.$db.addField({schema:User, key:\"username\",  type:\"string\", options:{ mandatory : true }, skipValidation:true});\n```\n\nNote: If a prop is added again, it will replace the old prop definition.\n\nUnregistering Schema\n\nIf you are looking for an option to unregister a schema, here it is. With this, one or arrays of schemas can be unregistered using unregisterSchema method in db Instance. And here is the syntax for it.\ndb.unregisterSchema(name / [name]);\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.unregisterSchema( \"user\" );\n(OR)\nthis.$db.unregisterSchema([ \"user\" , \"profile\" ]);\n```\n\nNote: Upon unregistering a schema, all the entities in that specific schema will only be dropped. The related data of the unloaded records will not be dropped.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Customizing Connector\nConnector\n\nA Connector is a callback layer, which can be used to set/modify URL format, headers, method, queryParams etc. Data store extends its support to both RESTConnector and GraphqlConnector, which support REST and Graphql standards respectively.\n\nGenerate Using CLI\n\nTo generate a connector using CLI, use the following command.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate connector user\n```\nSkeleton\n\nOn creating a connector, you can find the connector class. Have a look at the below code snippet to find out the available call backs. You can pass the required arguments based on your needs. Keep reading to understand the needs and importance of these callbacks.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTConnector } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass UserConnector extends RESTConnector{\n  host = \"https://crm.zoho.com\";\n  namespace = \"/crm\";\n  actionNamespace = \"/actions\";\n  withCredentials = true;\n  requestURL({schemaName, type, queryParams, payLoad, url, actionName, customData, key}){\n  }\n\n  requestMethod({method, type , queryParams , customData, actionName, key}){\n  }\n\n  requestHeaders({type, queryParams , customData, actionName, key}){\n  }\n\n  refetch({cachedData, queryParams}){\n  }\n\n  refetchAll({cachedData, queryParams}){\n  }\n\n  processRequest({type , schemeName , payLoad , cachedData , customData , queryParams , key, url, actionName, method, headers}){\n  }\n\n  parseResponse({type , schemaName , xhrObj , payLoad , queryParams, key, actionName}){\n  }\n\n  parseRequest({type , schemaName , xhr , queryParams , key , customData }){\n  }\n}\nexport { UserConnector };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { GraphqlConnector } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass UserConnector extends GraphqlConnector{\n    host = \"https://crm.zoho.com\";\n    namespace = \"/crm\";\n    withCredentials = true;\n    gql = {\n      query : {\n        user : `userProperties(id ID) { id name zuid }`\n      },\n      mutation : {\n        create:`createUser(user Object){\n            id\n            profile{\n              id\n            }\n        }`\n      }\n    }\n    buildGqlQuery({gqlObj}){\n\n    }\n    requestURL({schemaName, type, queryParams, payLoad, url, actionName, customData, key}){\n    }\n\n    requestMethod({method, type , queryParams , customData, actionName, key}){\n    }\n\n    requestHeaders({type, queryParams , customData, actionName, key}){\n    }\n\n    refetch({cachedData, queryParams}){\n    }\n\n    refetchAll({cachedData, queryParams}){\n    }\n\n    processRequest({type , schemeName , payLoad , cachedData , customData , queryParams , key, url, actionName, method, headers}){\n    }\n\n    parseResponse({type , schemaName , xhrObj , payLoad , queryParams, key, actionName}){\n    }\n\n    parseRequest({type , schemaName , xhr , queryParams , key , customData }){\n    }\n  }\n  export { UserConnector };\n```\nAdding to Schema\n\nYou can easily add the connector to the schema in two ways. You can either declare the connector as a variable or you can add it as a function and get it returned in the static connector just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb } from \"../db\";\nimport { UserConnector } from \"../connectors/user\";\nclass User extends AppDb.Schema{\n  static Connector = UserConnector;\n  props(){\n    return {\n      str: prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb } from \"../db\";\nimport { UserConnector } from \"../connectors/user\";\nimport { UserGqlConnector } from \"../connectors/user\"\nclass User extends AppDb.Schema{\n  static Connector({type}){\n    if(type == \"getAll\"){\n      return UserGqlConnector;\n    }\n    return UserConnector;\n  }\n  props(){\n    return {\n      str: prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nCallback Arguments\n\nAs mentioned above, you can pass the required arguments inside the object notation of the callbacks. Below is the list of arguments along with its properties.\n\nProperties and its details\nREST\nGraphql\ntype - type of method, which triggered the request( possible values - get / update / updateRecord / create / createRecord / delete / deleteRecord / destroyRecord / action )\nschemaName - name of the schema\nqueryParams - queryParams of the request\ndata - request data of the request\nentityData - request data of a single entity\npayLoad - response payLoad of the request\nentityPayload - response payLoad of a single entity\nopts - extra option of the method, which triggered the request\nmethod - method of the request(GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE)\nkey - primaryKey value of the entity\nhost - url host\nheaders - headers of the request\ncustomData - customData passed in the method\ncallback - callback name\ncachedData - cached entities\nactionName - name of the action defined in model\nxhr - XMLHTTPRequest object\n\nIf just one or two properties alone is required for a callback only that can be passed. Observe the below code to find out that only two arguments(type, url) is passed in the requestURL callback.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationConnector } from \"./application\";\nclass UserConnector extends ApplicationConnector{\n  requestURL({type, url}){\n    if(type == \"get\"){\n      return \"/users\"\n    }\n    return url;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserConnector };\n```\nStructuring a Connector\n\nIdeal way is to have an application connector as the base connector for the db. It is good to mention the same in the db. This should extend either RESTConnector or GraphqlConnector. All the schema specific connectors, should extend this application connector.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Db, GraphQLConnector } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass AppDb extends Db{\nstatic Connector = GraphQLConnector;\n}\nexport { AppDb };\n```\n\nBelow is an example for RESTConnector.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTConnector } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass ApplicationConnector extends RESTConnector{\n  requestURL({type, queryParams, url}){\n        return url;\n      }\n}\nexport { ApplicationConnector };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationConnector } from \"./application\";\nclass UserConnector extends ApplicationConnector{\n  requestURL({type, queryParams, url}){\n    if( type == \"get\" && queryParams.email ){\n        queryParams.default = true;\n    }\n    return url;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserConnector };\n```\nCommon Usage\nModify the URL\n\nURL can be modified in requestURL. callback of the adapter. This callback will be called before data store makes a API request, where you can modify the URL if needed.\n\n```javascript\nrequestURL({schemaName, type, queryParams, payLoad, url, actionName, customData}){\n  // Any Modification to URL\n  return url;\n}\n```\nModify the queryParams\n\nQuery params can be set or modified in the requestURL / requestMethod / requestHeaders connector callbacks, where the queryParams object is passed. You can set / modify the queryParams in that object, which is passed.\n\n```javascript\nrequestURL({ schemaName , type , queryParams , url }){\n  if( type == \"get\" && queryParams.email ){\n    queryParams.default = true;\n  }\n  return url;\n}\n```\n```javascript\nrequestHeaders({ type , queryParams}){\n  if( type == \"FINDALL\" && queryParams.email ){\n    queryParams.default = true;\n  }\n  return {};\n}\n```\n```javascript\nrequestMethod({ method }){\n  if( method == \"PATCH\" ){\n    return \"PUT\";\n  }\n  return method;\n}\n```\n\nNote: queryParams object passed is a reference object. Do no set any new object to it. Set or modify in the same object that is passed to the callbacks.\n\nSet the headers of request\n\nHeaders can be set for the request that are made via db. This callback will be called before any request that is made via db.\n\n```javascript\nrequestHeaders(){\n  return {\n    'API_KEY' : 'secret key',\n    'ANOTHER_HEADER' : 'Some header value'\n  };\n}\n```\nModify the method of request\n\nBy REST API standard, following methods will be added based on the specific use case.\n\nPOST - new record creation\nPATCH - any record changes\nDELETE - record deletion\nGET - get record details\n\nIf the method has to be changed for any of the use case, it can be done via requestMethod callback.\n\n```javascript\nrequestMethod({method}){\n  if( method == \"PATCH\" ){\n    return \"PUT\";\n  }\n  return method;\n}\n```\nReplace the request layer\n\nBy default, db will make request via javascript's default XHR methods. It can be replaced here, with a promise, which should be resolved on success and rejected on failure.\n\n```javascript\nprocessRequest({type}){\n  var prm;\n  if( type === \"findAll\" ){\n    prm = new Promise( function( resolve , reject ){\n      resolve( JSON.stringify({\n        todo : Object.keys( TODO ).map(function( k ){\n          return TODO[k]\n        })\n      }))\n    });\n  } else {\n    return undefined;\n  }\n  return prm;  // Promise\n}\n```\nCommon error handling for all the schema request\n\nparseResponse is the only adapter callback, which will be called after the response is received. XHR will be passed as a argument to this callback. It can be used to check, if the request is successful or not. Based on it, you can throw error messages, if needed.\n\nBy default, Data store expects response code to be 2xx for success and 3xx or 4xx for failure. Consider the case, where the server fails for particular API request, yet sends a success code. To handle such cases, use promise like the below code snippet to get it resolved for success or to reject it for failure.\n\n```javascript\nparseResponse({ type, XHR, payLoad}){\n  if( XHR.status == 400 ){\n    alert( \"Request failure\" );\n  }\n  return payLoad;\n}\n```\n```javascript\nparseResponse({ type , XHR , payLoad }}){\n  return new Promise( function(resolve,reject){\n    if( xhrObj.status == 200 ){\n      resolve(payLoad);\n    } else {\n      reject(payLoad);\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\nCalling parent connector\n\nUsing super, parent connector callbacks can be called. Arguments can also be called just like below.\n\n```javascript\nrequestURL(){\n    return super.requestURL(...arguments);\n}\n```\nInitialize customData\n\ncustomData can only be passed via some db / entity methods. You can also initialize customData in connector.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationConnector } from \"./application\";\nclass testConnector extends applicationConnector{\n  customData = {};\n  requestURL({customData, url}){\n    customData.processData = true;\n    return url;\n  }\n}\nexport { testConnector };\n```\nCustomizing GraphqlConnector\nConfigure / Modify gql query\n\nTo modify / configure the query name / variables, \"buildGqlQuery\" callback can be used. It should return an object with properties such as query and variables.\n\n```javascript\nbuildGqlQuery({type, gqlObj}){\n  if(gqlObj.queryName == \"user1\"){\n    gqlObj.variables = [\"id\"];\n  }\n  return gqlObj;\n}\n```\nModify the method of gql request\n\nBy Graphql API standard, all the cases are handled via POST method.\n\nIf the method has to be changed for any of the use case, it can be done via requestMethod callback.\n\n```javascript\nrequestMethod({type, method}){\n  if( type == \"updateEntity\" ){\n    return \"PUT\";\n  }\n  return method;\n}\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

Keep reading to understand the needs and importance of these callbacks..\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass UserSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({schemaName, type, payLoad, key, status, headers, queryParams, customData, opts }){\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n  serializePayload({type , data ,cachedData, customData, schemaName, queryParams, actionName}){\n    return data;\n  }\n  serializeKey({schemaName, type, customData, queryParams}){\n  }\n  getMeta({payLoad, schemaName, type, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  }\n  normalizeKey({schemaName, type, key, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  }\n  serializeEntity({entityData, schemaName, customData, url, type, queryParams, method, headers, withCredentials}){\n    var urlObj = {url:url, type:type, qP:queryParams, method:method, headers, headers, withCredentials:withCredentials};\n    return entityData;\n  }\n  normalizeEntity({entityPayload, schemaName, customData, url, type, queryParams, method, headers, withCredentials}){\n    var urlObj = {url:url, type:type, qP:queryParams, method:method, headers, headers, withCredentials:withCredentials};\n    return entityPayload;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { GraphqlSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass UserSerializer extends GraphqlSerializer{\n  serializeGqlQuery({gqlObj}){\n    return gqlObj\n  }\n  serializeSelfQuery({selfGqlObj}){\n    return selfGqlObj;\n  }\n  normalizePayload({schemaName, type, payLoad, key, status, headers, queryParams, customData, opts }){\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n  serializePayload({type , data ,cachedData, customData, schemaName, queryParams, actionName}){\n    return data;\n  }\n  serializeKey({schemaName, type, customData, queryParams}){\n  }\n  getMeta({payLoad, schemaName, type, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  }\n  normalizeKey({schemaName, type, key, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  }\n  serializeEntity({entityData, cachedData, schemaName, customData, url, type, queryParams, method, headers, withCredentials}){\n    var urlObj = {url:url, type:type, qP:queryParams, method:method, headers, headers, withCredentials:withCredentials};\n    return entityData;\n  }\n  normalizeEntity({entityPayload, schemaName, customData, url, type, queryParams, method, headers, withCredentials}){\n    var urlObj = {url:url, type:type, qP:queryParams, method:method, headers, headers, withCredentials:withCredentials};\n    return entityPayload;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nAdding to Schema\n\nIn the schema class, the serializer class can be added either in the static Serializer variable or can be returned in static Serializer method as below.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { UserSerializer } from \"../serializers/user\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  static Serializer = UserSerializer;\n  props(){\n    return {\n      str: prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { UserSerializer } from \"../serializers/user\";\nimport { UserGqlSerializer } from \"../serializers/gql/user\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  static Serializer({type}){\n    if(type == \"updateEntity\"){\n      return UserGqlSerializer;\n    }\n    return UserSerializer;\n  }\n  props(){\n    return {\n      str: prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nCallback Arguments\n\nAs mentioned above, you can pass the required arguments inside the object notation of the callbacks. Below is list of arguments along with its properties.\n\nProperties and its details\nREST\nGraphql\ntype - type of method, which triggered the request( possible values - get / update / updateRecord / create / createRecord / delete / deleteRecord / destroyRecord / action )\nschemaName - name of the schema\nqueryParams - queryParams of the request\ndata - request data of the request\nentityData - request data of a single entity\npayLoad - response payLoad of the request\nentityPayload - response payLoad of a single entity\nopts - extra option of the method, which triggered the request\nmethod - method of the request(GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE)\nkey - primaryKey value of the entity\nhost - url host\nheaders - headers of the request\ncustomData - customData passed in the method\ncallback - callback name\ncachedData - cached entities\nactionName - name of the action defined in model\nxhr - XMLHTTPRequest object\n\nIf just one property is required for a callback, it can be destructured like below\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({payLoad}){\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nExpected Response Structure\n\nFor all types of request, datastore will expect the response in a specific format. It should be an object which can have two keys, one with schemaName value as the key which has the payload data as value and other with meta key which has the meta information of the request.\n\n[schemaName] : [Response data]\n\"meta\" : [meta information]\n\nConsider for the schema with name \"user\", following structure will be expected.\n\n```javascript\n{\n        \"user\" : { } /  [  ] ,\n        \"meta\" : Some meta information which can be of any type ( Optional )\n}\n```\nStructuring a Serializer\n\nIdeal way is to have an application serializer as the base serializer for the db. It is good to mention the same in the db. This should extend either RESTSerializer / GraphqlSerializer. All the schema specific connectors, should extend this application connector.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Db, RESTConnector, RESTSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass AppDb extends Db{\nstatic Serializer = GraphQL;\n}\nexport { AppDb };\n```\n\nBelow is an example for RESTSerializer.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass ApplicationSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({type, queryParams, payLoad}){\n        return payLoad;\n      }\n}\nexport { ApplicationSerializer };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({payLoad}){\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nUsage\nModify the response - from server\n\nResponse received from the server, will be expected in some format by the data store. Check expected response structure before it is given to data store, if it is not in the format as the data store expects, then it can be modified in normalizePayload or normalizeEntity callbacks as per the needs.\n\nFirst entire response will be received in normalizePayload callback. And you can use normalizeEntity callback to call each data entity object.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  normalizeEntity({schemaName, type, entityPayload, customData, opts}){\n    entityPayload.fromServer = true;\n    return entityPayload;\n  }\n  normalizePayload({schemaName, type, payLoad, key, xhr, headers, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n    payLoad[ schemaName ].sort( function( a , b ){ return a.id > b.id })\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n});\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nModify the payload - to server\n\nBefore a request data is sent to server, serializeEntity callback will be called for each entity object that is being sent to server. Then the entire payload will be recevied in serialize callback, where the request serializePayload structure can be modified, if needed.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  serializeEntity({schemaName, type, entityData, customData, opts}){\n    return entityData;\n  }\n  serializePayload({schemaName, type, data, key, xhr, headers, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n    return data;\n  }\n});\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nDetermine the payLoad data key\n\nIf the schema data is received in some other key other than its schemaName key, then you can specify the key for which the schema data is received, in normalizeKey callback in the serializer.\n\n```javascript\nnormalizeKey({schemaName , type , key , queryParams , customData, opts}){\n  return \"data\";\n}\n```\nDetermine the metadata for the request\n\nIn simple terms, Metadata is some additional information about the request.\nsuch pageno, perpage etc.,\n\nMetadata can be returned for a request in the serializer callback getMeta .\n\n```javascript\ngetMeta({payLoad, schemaName, type, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  return payLoad.meta;\n}\n```\nMethod for calling parent serializer callbacks\n\nUsing super, parent serializer callbacks can be called. Arguments can be called like below\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({payLoad}){\n    return super.normalizePayload(..arguments);\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nCustomizing GraphqSerializer\nConfigure / modify the base graphql query\n\nThe query which is sent to the server can be configured or customized in serializeGqlQuery. In serializeGqlQuery, entire query with its variables will be received as an argument in gqlObj, which can be modified if required and returned.\n\n```javascript\nserializeGqlQuery({type, gqlObj}){\n  if(type !== \"deleteEntity\" || type !== \"delete\"){\n      gqlObj.variables={insert_Data:gqlObj.data}\n  }\n  else{\n      gqlObj.variables={delete_data:gqlObj.data}\n  }\n  return gqlObj;\n}\n```\n\nHere, in this query gglObj and in its callback, an object gets returned with the following keys,\n\ntype - Query or Mutation\nquery - query in object structure\nmutation - query in object structure\nvariables - variables of query\nqueryType - default or namedQuery or query\nqueryName - query name (for namedQuery)\nmutationType - default or namedMutation or customMutation\nmutationName - mutation name (for namedMutation)\nConfigure / modify any self graphql query\n\nTo serialize any query either for the parent schema or relation schema, serializeSelfQuery callback can be used. In simple terms, this can be used for the nested or the parent model.\n\nExample: If we make a query for user(parent) and the profile as child, then for user, user serializer's serializeSelfQuery gets called and for profile, the profile serializer's serializeSelfQuery get called.\n\n```javascript\nserializeSelfQuery({type, selfGqlObj}){\n  return selfGqlObj.query;\n}\n```\n\nHere, in this query selfGqlobj and in its callback an object gets returned with the following keys,\n\nquery - properties of that schema in array structure\nvariables - variables of the query as object\n\nHere, It returns the subfields(array) for the given call backs.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Error Handling\n\nProper handling of errors makes the application clean. Have a glimpse on the below document to figure out the ways to handle the error. But where to find the errors?\n\nYou can find the error details in entity.$.error as an object with the key containing the error codes, error messages.\n\nValidation Error\n\nEntity will only hold the successfully validated value. If there is any validation error while setting / creating, the value will not be set and the error will be thrown. Error details will be available in entity.$.error and the entity.$.isError will be set to true.\n\nentity.$.error is an object with property name as the key and error object as the value. Check here to know about the structure of error object.\n\nnewEntity\n```javascript\nvar entity = this.$db.newEntity({ schema:Profile, data:{ name:\"john\", phone:12344 }});\nif(entity.$.isError){\n   // error handling\n   console.log(entity.$.error);\n   // error details\n}\n```\n\nNote: In case of newEntity, for any validation failures, error object will be returned. Entity object will not be created in such cases.\n\nset\n```javascript\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:Profile, pK:\"1\" });\nentity.$.set(\"name\", 123);\nif(entity.$.isError){\n  // error handling\n  console.log ( entity.$.error ) ; // error details\n}\n```\nError Object\n\nError object has the following keys:\n\ncode - Error code\nmessage - Error message\nexpected - Expected type\nvalue - value that was set\n\nError Codes\n\nIf entity's value did not match the given validation rules, the following error codes and error messages will be set in the error object.\n\nS.NO\tERROR CODE\tREASON\n1\tERR01\tWhen a primary key is being modified.\n2\tERR02\tWhen mandate field is set to empty.\n3\tERR03\tType of value does not match the specified data type\",\"expected\":\"string.\n4\tERR04\tWhen the given value is greater than the specified maximum limit (maximum check fails).\n5\tERR05\tWhen the given value is less than the specified minimum limit (minimum check fails)\n6\tERR06\tWhen the length of a given string/array is greater than the specified value (maxLength/maxItems check fails)\n7\tERR07\tWhen the length of the given string/array is less than the specified value (minLength/minItems check fails)\n8\tERR08\tWhen the given string does not match the specified regex (pattern check fails)\n9\tERR09\tWhen the values in the given array are not unique (unique check fails)\n10\tERR10\tWhen the given value is not equal to the specified constant (constant check fails)\n11\tERR11\tWhen the model of a related field is not defined.\n12\tERR12\tWhen the model of the backward relation field is not defined.\n13\tERR13\tWhen an empty record is set for a relation.\n14\tERR14\tThis error gets thrown if the related field model and the specified model does not match\n15\tERR15\tWhile creating a new record, if an object has been passed as a related field value, and if that object fails in creating a record.\n16\tERR16\tThis gets thrown, while trying to create a new record with a primary key value of an exisiting record.\n17\tERR17\tTrying to change a value of a record which has been deleted.\n18\tERR18\tAction not defined\n19\tERR19\tModel not defined while trying to perform CRUD operations.\n20\tERR20\tKey for findRecord not specified.\n21\tERR21\tExpecting a single object or id, instead of an array.\n22\tERR22\tType not specified for a polymorphic relation\n23\tERR23\tPrimary Key value not present\n24\tERR24\tError while relating record\n25\tERR25\tBackward relation not present\n26\tERR26\tPrimary key value cannot be undefined or null\n26\tERR26\tObserver can observe only string data type value\n\nThe error messages can be modified using setErrorMessages method in store. Ex: store.setErrorMessages({ERRO1:I18n.getMessage(\"isEmpty\")}); .\n\nRequest Error\nIn API request\n\nIn case of any request related failures (like response code 4** or 5**), XHR object will be given in the failure callbacks of any store related requests.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../../data-store/schemas/blog\";\nthis.$db.getAll({ schema:Blog }).then(\nfunction( data ){\n// success function\n},\nfunction( xhr ){\n// failure function\n}\n);\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Blog } from \"../../data-store/schemas/blog\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({ schema:Blog, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.save().then(\nfunction( data ){\n  // success function\n},\nfunction( xhr ){\n  // failure function\n}\n);\n```\nPartial Success handling\n\nAt times while dealing with multiple create, update and delete you may face partial success. The term partial success refers that not all entities gets successfully created, updated or deleted. Few errors may occur. And to handle such error, return the response payload of the failed entity in the following structure\n\n```javascript\n{\n  $ : {\n    isError : true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLet us consider a schema named as user in which you can expect the partial success response as follows while creating the entity.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  user: [{\n      id:\"1\"\n    },\n    {\n      id:\"2\"\n    },\n    {\n      $: {\n        isError: true\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      id:\"4\"\n    },\n    {\n      $: {\n        isError: true\n        }\n    }]\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, three entities are successfully created and two entities are not created. In such responses, changes will be persisted according to the response.\n\nMerge server error with entity error\n\nServer validation error for attributes can be merged with the entity, when the entity payload is in the following structure,\n\n```javascript\n{\n  error: {\n    name : { code: \"ERR03\", message: \"test\"}\n  },\n  $ : {\n    isError : true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nLet us consider a schema named as 'user',handling multiple create, response payload would be expected as follows\n\n```javascript\n{\nuser: [{\n    id:\"1\"\n  },\n  {\n    id:\"2\"\n  },\n  {\n    error:{\n      name: { code: \"ERR03\", message: \"invalid data\"}\n    },\n    $:{\n      isError: true\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    id:\"4\"\n  },\n  {\n    error:{\n      phone : { code: \"ERR03\", message: \"invalid data\" }\n    },\n    $: {\n      isError : true\n    }\n  }]\n}\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Event & Callbacks\nEvents Handling\n\nFor an event, one or more event listeners can be created. All the listeners will be called one by one, when that specific event occurs. Below are the list of possible events thrown at different scopes.\n\nFor an entity events like change, error, set can be thrown.\n\nFor a Schema, events like add,remove,change can be thrown.\n\nFor a db Instance, events like add,remove,change,beforeRequest, afterRequest can be thrown.\n\nKeep reading the following sections to see how the events can be handled with much ease.\n\nHooks\n\nIn simple words, hooks are nothing but methods,helping you out with adding,removing and emiting the event listeners at different scopes.\n\naddEventListener:\n\nThis helps you to add event listeners while you add, remove or make any change to target(entity.$/schema/db). With this hook, you get an 'id' in return. Have a look at the below code snippet to see how it works.\n\nThe syntax is as follows:\n\ntarget.addEventListener(type,function(){..});\n```javascript\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema: TodoSchema, pK:\"1\"});\nvar id = entity.$.addEventListener( \"change\" , function(data , attr ){\n  console.log( \"changes in entity-\" , data );\n});\nvar eid = entity.$.addEventListener( \"error\" , function( data , attr , errorObj ){\n  console.log( \"validation error in attr\" , attr , \"for\" , data );\n));\n```\n```javascript\nvar schema = this.$db.getSchema(\"todo\");\nvar id_1 = schema.addEventListener( \"add\" , function( data ){\nconsole.log( data , \"is added\" );\n});\nvar id_2 = schema.addEventListener( \"change\" , function( data , attr ){\n// attr - an array of attributes\nconsole.log( \"changes in record-\" , data , \"for attr\" , attr );\n});\nvar id_3 = schema.addEventListener( \"remove\" , function( data ){\nconsole.log(data , \"is removed\" );\n});\n```\n```javascript\nvar id_4 = this.$db.addEventListener( \"add\" , function ( schemaName , entity ){\n  console.log( entity , \"is added to schema-\" , schemaName );\n});\nvar id_5 = this.$db.addEventListener( \"change\" , function ( schemaName , entity , attr ){\n  console.log( \"changes in entity-\" , entity , \"for attr\" , attr , \"for schema-\" , schemaName );\n});\nvar id_6 = this.$db.addEventListener( \"remove\" , function ( schemaName , entity ){\n  console.log( entity , \"is removed from schema-\" , schemaName );\n});\nvar id_7 = this.$db.addEventListener( \"beforeRequest\" , function ( XHR , schemaName , type , key, queryParams ){\n\n});\nvar id_8 = this.$db.addEventListener( \"afterRequest\" , function ( XHR , modelName , type , key, queryParams ){\n\n});\n```\nremoveEventListener:\n\nThis hook helps you to remove event listeners from the target. It helps you out to remove single listener with respect to id, specific type like add,remove and change. It also lets you to remove all listeners.\n\nTo remove the event with respect to id and type, both the id and type has to be passed as an argument to removeEventListener.\n\nThe syntax is as follows:\n\ntarget.removeEventListener(id/type);\n```javascript\nimport { TodoSchema } from \"../../data-store/schemas/todo\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema: TodoSchema, pK:\"1\"});\n// Using id\nentity.$.removeEventListener( id );\n// Using type\nentity.$.removeEventListener( \"change\" );\n// To remove all\nentity.$.removeEventListener();\n```\n```javascript\nvar schema = this.$db.getSchema( \"blog\" );\n// Using id\nschema.removeEventListener( id_1 );\n// Using type\nschema.removeEventListener( \"add\" ); // removes all add event listeners\n// To remove all\nschema.removeEventListener();        // removes all(add/remove/change) listeners registered to schema\n```\n```javascript\n// Using id\nthis.$db.removeEventListener(id_4 );\n// Using type\nthis.$db.removeEventListener(\"change\" );\n// To remove all\nthis.$db.removeEventListener(); // removes all(add/remove/change) listeners registered to store\n```\nemit:\n\nYou can also add custom event listeners other than add/change/remove. Use emit to call such listeners whenever necessary.\n\nThe syntax is as follows:\n\ntarget.emit ( type ,[ args ] );,where args is an array of arguments\n```javascript\nimport { TodoSchema } from \"../../data-store/schemas/todo\";\nvar entity = this.$db.cache.getEntity({schema: TodoSchema, pK:\"1\"});\nentity.$.addEventListener( \"custom\" , function( args ){\n  // custom listener function\n});\n// Call emit to throw this event\nentity.$.emit( \"custom\" , [ \"arguments\" ]);\n```\n```javascript\nvar schema = this.$db.getSchema( \"blog\" );\nschema.addEventListener( \"custom\" , function( args ){\n  // custom listener function\n});\n// Call emit to throw this event\nschema.emit( \"custom\" , [ \"arguments\" ]);\n```\n```javascript\nthis.$db.addEventListener( \"custom\" , function ( args ){\n  // custom listener function\n});\n// Call emit to throw this event\nthis.$db.emit( \"custom\" , [ \"arguments\" ]);\n```\n\nNote: These listeners will be invoked in the order of schema,entity,db.\n\nEvents\nEntity:\n\nBelow are the events that are thrown to the entity.\n\nchange:\n\nWhenever there is a change in the value of any defined attribute in a entity(through any data set utils ), change event will be thrown to that specific entity scope. Event listener can be added to it to listen to it as below.

    "order": 40,
    "content": "IndexedDB\n(From 1.0.3-beta5)\nIntroduction\n\nIt is a web storage solution used to store significant amounts of data with a same origin policy. Lyte data store provides an option to store the db data in the indexedDB (either db data can be cached directly in indexedDB or with the queryParams that is used to fetch the data from the server).\n\nAdvantages:\n\nIf the same subsequent request is made(either from the current tab or another tab of same domain), it will fetch the data from indexedDB (if the option is given to cache data in IDB). This will save a significant amount of time to fetch the data from the server, which in turn makes the page load faster.\n\ninit\n\nTo init the indexeddb, create a LyteIDB lookup like below.\n\ndb - db instance\nurl - path of the lyte-idb-worker js file\nname - name of the idb instance\nrestoreData - boolean, to restore the current data in , so. Default - false\n```javascript\nimport { Db } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { LyteIDB } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { applicationConnector } from \"./connectors/application\";\nimport { application } from \"./serializers/application\";\nclass crmDb extends Db{\n    static Connector = applicationConnector; // or RESTConnector\n    static Serializer = application; // or RESTSerializer\n    lookups() {\n        return [\n          {\n            idb: new LyteIDB({db: this, name:\"crm\", url:location.origin+\"/node_modules/@slyte/data/src/lyte-idb-worker.js\"})\n          }\n        ];\n    }\n}\nexport { crmDb }\n```\nrestoreData\n\nrestoreData is an boolean variable. If it returns true ,data will be restored even when the last tab is closed else the data will be removed on the closing of last tab , By default it will be false\n\nidb option\nQueryCache\n\nif queryCache is true , then the request will be cached with its respective queryParams along with its data.\nif queryCache is false , then the data will be cached in IndexedDB\n\nDeserializeKeys\n\nIt is used to specify the relationships which are to be saved in IDB along with the actual schema data. If it is not specified, all the relationships will be saved by default.\n\ncache\nwith queryParams\n\nIf a data store's GET request is made with queryParams, this option can be used to cache the data in the indexedDB with its queryParams. When the request is made with the same queryParams, then the cached data from the indexeddb will be returned.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Blog } from \"./blog\";\nimport { Tag } from \"./tag\";\nimport { Organization } from \"./organization\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  idb(){\n    return {\n      queryCache : true,\n      deserializeKeys : [ \"blogs\" ]\n    }\n  }\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      username : prop( \"string\" ),\n      blogs : many( Blog ),\n      tags : many( Tag ),\n      org : many( Organization )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n\ndb.getAll({schema: user, qP: {org: [\"1\", \"2\"]}});\n\nFor the above request, the response data will be cached with the above queryParams. ( {org:['1', '2']}) Now if the \"user\" schema data is requested with the same queryParams, then the data will be returned from indexedDB, else a request will be made to server to fetch data.\n\nwithout queryParams\n\nData can also be saved without queryParams. In this case, all the cached data will be returned on subsequent request.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Tag } from \"./tag\";\nclass Blog extends Schema{\n  idb(){\n    return {\n      queryCache : false\n    }\n  }\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      description : prop( \"string\" ),\n      tags : many( Tag )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\nCallbacks\nidbBeforeOpen\n\nThis is a application connector callback.By default objectStores are created in indexeddb only while opening/registering indexeddb. Lyte data store will open/register indexeddb with the schema's loaded initially. If some schema is being loaded later, it should be added initially in the idbBeforeOpen callback.\n\nidbBeforeOpen callback will be called before schemas are registered to indexedDB. You can add the schema name with its primary keys in this callback.\n\n```javascript\nclass ApplicationConnector extends RESTConnector{\n  idbBeforeOpen({models}){\n    models.push({ modelName : \"territory\" , pK : \"id\" });\n    return models;\n  }\n}\n```\nidbResponse\n\nThis is a serializer callback. It can be specified either in schema specific or application serializer. It can be used to determine whether the data is correct. On returning false, a server request will be made to fetch data.\n\n```javascript\nclass ApplicationSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n  idbResponse({schemaName:modelName , type , queryParams , key , payLoad}){\n    if( payLoad.length == 10 ){\n      return payLoad;\n    }\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOn returning false, it will make a XHR request and fetch the data from server.\n\nThis is a serializer callback. It can be specified either in schema specific or application serializer. beforeIDBGet callback will be responsible for the GET operation to be done in the IDB\n\n```javascript\nclass UserSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n  beforeIDBGet({idbObj}){\n    // obj.name = \"some\";\n    return idbObj\n  }\n}\n```\nbeforeIDBGet\n\nThis is a serializer callback. It can be specified either in schema specific or application serializer. beforeIDBGet callback will be responsible for the GET operation to be done in the IDB\n\n```javascript\nclass UserSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n  beforeIDBGet({idbObj}){\n    // obj.name = \"some\";\n    return idbObj\n  }\n}\n```\nbeforeIDBCrud\n\nThis is a serializer callback. It can be specified either in schema specific or application serializer. beforeIDBCrud callback will be responsible for the CRUD operations to be done in the IDB\n\n```javascript\nclass UserSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n  beforeIDBCrud({idbObj}){\n    // obj.name = \"some\";\n    return idbObj\n  }\n}\n```\n\nEither the data received in the beforeIDBGet / beforeIDBCrud can be modified or if they return undefined / false it will ignore that particular operation to IDB.\n\ntriggerIDBInsertion\n\nThis is used to initialize indexeddb operations. By default, this method will be called by lyte data store.\n\nThis function can be manually triggered, by specifying the option differIDBAction in application connector to true\n\nremoveIDBDatabase\n\nThis is used to remove the indexeddb database whenever necessary.\n\n```javascript\nthis.$db.$idb.removeIDBDatabase();\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

A service is a piece encapsulated code for which the instances get created and accessible in the particular 'this' context of any slyte module.\n\nsLyte helps in instantiating the services unlike mixins and makes it usable across the entire application with the help of lookups.\n\nBefore diving into the lookups, let us first see how to create a service in sLyte.\n\nCreating a Service\n\nsLyte helps in instantiating the services and makes it usable across the entire application with the help of lookups. Before diving into the lookups, let us first see how to create a service in sLyte.\n\nService can be created by using the lyte generate command. Here is a syntax for creating a service named 'requestHandler'.\n\nlyte generate service requestHandler\n\nLet us consider an example\n\n```javascript\nimport {Service} from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass RequestHandler extends Service {\n\tlogRequest() {\n\t}\n\tonRequestError() {\n\t}\n}\nexport default RequestHandler;\n```\n\nHere, you have created a service named \"RequestHandler\" which can be used across the application. Based on the requirements, the user-defined functions can be declared. Here, the user-defined functions logRequest() and onRequestError() are declared.\n\nLooking up a Service\n\nNow that you have created a service, you need to declare it in the places where you need to use it. To do so, sLyte has come up with lookups. In simple words, employ 'lookups' hooks to use the services.\n\nLet us consider an example:\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppComponentRegistry } from \"../component\";\nimport {RequestHandler} from \"../services/request-handler\";\nclass WelcomeComp extends ComponentRegistry{\n\tlookups() {\n\t\treturn [RequestHandler];\n\t}\n}\nexport default WelcomeComp;\n```\n\nThe \"lookups\" hook specifies the list of services to be used in a particular module of sLyte, when it gets instantiated. In this example, you have included the RequestHandler Service in the lookups hook of the WelcomeComp. In this way, you are communicating to the framework that you need to use the mentioned service whenever the component is created.\n\nUsing a Service\n\nAfter specifying the lookups, the appropriate instantiation of the mentioned services takes place. In our example, whenever a WelcomeComp component is being created, the lookups, check for the service named \"RequestHandler\" and then instantiate it accordingly and make it available in the context of the component for using the services.\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppComponentRegistry } from \"../component\";\nimport {RequestHandler} from \"../services/request-handler\";\nclass WelcomeComp extends AppComponentRegistry.Component {\n\tlookups() {\n\t\treturn [RequestHandler];\n\t}\n\tstatic actions() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\"errorHandling\" : function() {\n\t\t\t\tthis.$requestHandler.onRequestError();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport default WelcomeComp;\n```\n\nWhat does a lookups do?\n\nIn general, a lookup in sLyte checks if the instance for the service is created in app.js,and if it is created then the same instance can be used. And if the instance for the service is not created, the lookups creates an instance and stores in app.js and makes it available across the application.\n\nIn the above example, whenever the component WelcomeComp is getting instantiated, it will create a new instance of RequestHandler Service if an instance is not readily available, or else it will share the already created instance in the context of the component's this with the name of the service in camelCase preceding by a \"$\".\n\nSo now the instance of RequestHandler is being placed in the component's this context as $requestHandler\n\nNamed Service Lookup\n\nBy default, the name in which the service becomes available in the module will be \"$\"+<<CamelCase_Name_Of_Service>>. In the above example, it will be \"$requestHandler\". However, you can change this behaviour by mentioning the Service as a key-value pair, where the key becomes the name under which the service becomes available for the module.\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppComponentRegistry } from \"../component\";\nimport {RequestHandler} from \"../services/request-handler\";\nclass WelcomeComp extends AppComponentRegistry.Component {\n\tlookups() {\n\t\treturn [{\"myNewRequestHandler\" : RequestHandler}];\n\t}\n\tstatic actions() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\"errorHandling\" : function() {\n\t\t\t\tthis.$myNewRequestHandler.onRequestError();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport default WelcomeComp;\n```\n\nIn the above example, we had given a different name \"myNewRequestHandler\" in the service lookup and therefore, it becomes available in the component as \"$myNewRequestHandler\".\n\nInstantiation of a Service\n\nBy default, if you mention the Service class in the lookups, sLyte creates an instance in the scope of the app and then it shares it across the application.\n\nIn the above example, no matter how many times the WelcomeComp gets created, sLyte ensures that only a single instance of the RequestHandler Service is created and then shares it across multiple instances of the component.\n\nHowever, there can be cases, where you need to create a new instance for a service or you might need to take control of how the instantiation is happening. In such cases, you can instantiate the service yourself and return it in the lookup.\n\n```javascript\nimport { AppComponentRegistry } from \"../component\";\nimport {RequestHandler} from \"../services/request-handler\";\nclass WelcomeComp extends AppComponentRegistry.Component {\n\tlookups() {\n\t\treturn [{\"newRequestHandler\" : new RequestHandler(\"abc\")}];\n\t}\n\tstatic actions() {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\t\"errorHandling\" : function() {\n\t\t\t\tthis.$newRequestHandler.onRequestError();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\nexport default WelcomeComp;\n```\n\nIn this way, every new instance of the component will have a separate instance of the Service RequestHandler.\n\nsLyte Modules as Service\n\nsLyte Modules such as Router, ComponentRegistry, or Db, are exposed as Services, so that they can be used across other modules with ease, just like how a normal Service can be used.\n\n```javascript\nimport {SampleDb} from \"../data-store/db\"\nclass SampleRouter extends Router {\n\tlookups(){\n\t\treturn [{\"db\" : SampleDb}];\n\t}\n}\nexport {SampleRouter}\n```\n```javascript\nimport {SampleRouter} from \"../router/router.js\"\nclass SampleComponent extends Component {\n\tlookups(){\n\t\treturn [{\"router\" : SampleRouter}];\n\t}\n}\nexport {SampleComponent}\n```\n\nHere SampleRouter looks up for the service \"db\". And for all the services, including the services called inside the service, the service gets created in the app's scope.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 43,
    "content": "Mixins\nIntroduction\n\nMixins are used to share re-usable code across your application. You can define the methods which are to be used across your application in a mixin. It can be included as part of component / schema / connector / serializer / route.\n\nMixin class gets placed as a inherited class to acheive modularity. With this you can include reusable methods or properties in other classes through inheritance. On including a mixin class to another class, its methods and properties become accessible in the class instance.\n\nIn precise, Mixins are added in other classes through multiple inheritance where they allow classes to inherit behavior from multiple sources.\n\nOn speaking about the functionality of mixin, code reusability plays a vital role in it. On providing a way to share methods or properties across multiple classes it reduces code duplication to a great extent.\n\nCreating a mixin\n\nTo create a mixin, create a class which should extend Mixin class from \"@slyte/core\". You can define the methods and properties with in it. With this mixin class, you get this piece of code shared across the application.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Mixin } from \"@slyte/core\";\n\nclass SampleMixin extends Mixin {\n  generateMixin() {\n    return \"This is new Mixin\";\n    }\n}\n\nexport { SampleMixin };\n```\n\nLet us create another mixin.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Mixin } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass NotificationMixin extends Mixin {\n  sendBrowserNotification(){\n   return \"Hello, you have received a message\"\n    }\n  }\nexport { NotificationMixin };\n```\nCreating a mixin with CLI\n\nYou can also generate a mixin with CLI by executing the following command\n\nlyte generate mixin <mixin-name> [options]\nUsing a mixin\n\nTo use a mixin in a particular module of sLyte, add the mixin class to 'includes' method of parent class just like below code snippet. During the compile time, sLyte will take care of inheriting the particular mixin to the parent class.\n\nLets us create a mixin named 'NotificationMixin'.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Mixin } from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass NotificationMixin extends Mixin {\nsendBrowserNotification(message){\n  if (!(\"Notification\" in window)) {\n    alert(\"This browser does not support desktop notification\");\n  }\n  else if (Notification.permission === \"granted\") {\n    const notification = new Notification(message);\n  }\n  else if (Notification.permission !== \"denied\") {\n    Notification.requestPermission().then((permission) => {\n  if(permission === \"granted\") {\n    const notification = new Notification(message);\n  }});\n}}\nsendNotification(message, preference) {\n  preference = preference || \"browser\";\n  switch (preference) {\n  case 'browser':\n     this.sendBrowserNotification(message);\n     break;\n  default:\n     console.warn(`No valid notification preference`);\n  }\n}\nsendPriorityNotification(message) {\n  this.sendBrowserNotification(`URGENT: ${message}`);\n  console.log('High-priority notification sent');\n}\nsendDelayedNotification(message, delay) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    this.sendNotification(message);\n  },delay);\n  console.log(`Notification will be sent in ${delay / 1000} seconds`);\n  }\n}\nexport {NotificationMixin};\n```\n\nOn creating the notificationMixin, you can use it in route, component and datastore as seen in the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/route\";\nimport { NotificationMixin } from \"../mixins/NotificationMixin\"\nclass Home extends Route {\n  includes(){\n    return [NotificationMixin];\n  }\n  fetch() {\n    this.sendNotification(\"Home Page loading...\");\n  }\n}\nexport { Home };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport { NotificationMixin } from \"../mixins/NotificationMixin\"\nclass BlogComponent extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      // Data that is processed in template.\n    }\n  }\n  includes(){\n    return [NotificationMixin];\n  }\n  actions(){\n    return {\n        save: function(){\n            this.sendNotification(\"Blog is saved\");\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogComponent};\n```\n```javascript\nimport { RESTConnector } from \"@slyte/data\";\n  import { NotificationMixin } from \"../mixins/NotificationMixin\"\n  class UserConnector extends RESTConnector{\n    includes(){\n      return [SampleMixin];\n    }\n    processRequest() {\n     this.sendNotification(\"User request triggered\");\n    }\n  }\nexport { UserConnector };\n```\n\nOn creating and extending the mixin in any sLyte modules, the methods and properties are available in the 'this' context of that particular moule's instance.\n\nIf your application desires a shared and scoped instance, sLyte advises you to go for Services.\n\nGo Extramile\n\nIn this section, you will get to know, how mixins are placed as inherited class.\n\nMultiple mixin\n\nWhen associating a mixin to a component, its content is available in the 'this' scope. Similarly, multiple mixins can also be associated to the same file to ensure that its contents are also available in the same scope.\n\nWhen multiple mixins are included in the sLyte module, the mixins will be added as an extended class to the particular module during the build time.\n\nWhen mixins are included in a slyte module class, that class will inherit the mixins classes in the order provided. Based on that, methods / properties can be accessed from that instance.\n\nLet us consider an example, where Welcome component uses Mixin1 and Mixin2\n\nWelcome Comp -> Mixin1 -> Mixin2\n\nHere, Welcome comp's properties and methods will have preference over the Mixin1, Mixin2 in order.\n\nUsing Array or object in mixin\n\nSince mixins are added to classes via inheritance, any object or array property is not shared across instances of classes that use that particular mixin, unlike in the lyte version. But to achieve the same behaviour in slyte, add the comment \"//@old\" at the end of the property's definition of that class.\n\n```javascript\nclass UsersMixin extends Mixin{\n currentUser = { id:'1', name: 'Peter }; //old\n getUsers(){\n     return fetch(\"users\");\n }\n }\n```\nThings to Know\n\nMixins can't be instantiated on their own. They are used only to add functionality to other classes. If you want the piece of code to get instantiated on its own, in such case you can use services.\n\nMixins are added in other classes through inheritance, allowing classes to inherit from multiple mixins.\n\nMixins provide a way to share methods or properties across multiple classes, reducing code duplication.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data. We do have a host of other libraries, tools and extensions which ease the app development making it faster to build apps using sLyte.\n\nGit RepoRelease Notes Forum"

This is useful if you are having a large string and don't want it to be displayed as an attribute of the component in the DOM.\n\nExample with hideAttr as true: In the below example 'some-data' attribute is hidden from DOM tree since we defined 'some-data' with hideAttr property.\n\n```javascript\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n  <my-component some-data = \"{{largeString}}\">  </my-component>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {prop} from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data(){\n    return {\n      largeString : prop(\"string\",{default : \"this is very large string\"})\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n<template tag-name=\"my-component\">\n  <div> some content </div>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {prop} from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass MyComponent extends Component{\n  data(){\n    return {\n      someData : prop(\"string\",{hideAttr : true})\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n<my-component>\n  <div> some content </div>\n</my-component>\n```\n\nExample with hideAttr as false: In the below example 'some-data' attribute will be displayed in DOM tree\n\nThe framework doesnot render boolean attribute but as the 'hideAttr' is decalred as false, the framework renders it just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n  <my-component some-data = \"{{boolean}}\">  </my-component>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {prop} from \"@slyte/core\";\n  class BlogPost extends Component{\n    data : function(){\n      return {\n        boolean : prop(\"boolean\",{default : true})\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n```javascript\n<template tag-name=\"my-component\">\n  <div> some content </div>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {prop} from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass MyComponent extends Component{\n  data : function(){\n    return {\n      someData : prop(\"string\",{hideAttr : false})\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n<my-component some-data=this is very large string>\n  <div> some content </div>\n</my-component>\n```\n\nExample without hideAttr: In the below example 'some-data' attribute will be displayed in DOM tree.\n\n```javascript\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n  <my-component some-data = \"{{largeString}}\">  </my-component>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {prop} from \"@slyte/core\";\n  class BlogPost extends Component{\n    data : function(){\n      return {\n        largeString : prop(\"string\",{default : \"this is very large string\"})\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n```javascript\n<template tag-name=\"my-component\">\n  <div> some content </div>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {prop} from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass MyComponent extends Component{\n  data : function(){\n    return {\n      someData : prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\n<my-component some-data=this is very large string>\n  <div> some content </div>\n</my-component>\n```\n\nNote: hideAttr attribute will be hidden from the DOM only when the attribute is passed to sLyte component. It will not work with native elements.\n\nmandatory\n\nThe \"mandatory\" option can be provided inorder to ensure the given data is valid. The value cannot be null or undefined or empty string.\n\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {prop} from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component{\n  data : function(){\n    return {\n      fieldName : prop(\"string\",{default : \"user\",mandatory : true})\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nDuring inital rendering, the data might be undefined or null or empty string, In those cases you need to skip mandatory validation by passing the flag \"skipValidationOnInit\" as true as follows.\n\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {prop} from \"@slyte/core\";\n  class BlogPost extends Component{\n    data : function(){\n      return {\n        fieldName : prop(\"string\",{default : \"\",mandatory : {skipValidationOnInit : true}})\n      }\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nAssume there might be the case where we want to reset the mandatory data to empty. For example. if we want to reset the form field data , which might have mandatory flag, then you can pass the \"skipValidation\" option on setdata and component's set method API's.\n\n```javascript\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n  <form>\n    <label for=\"username\">User name:</label>\n    <input type=\"text\" id=\"username\" name=\"username\" value=\"{{lbind(fieldName)}}\">\n    <button onclick=\"{{action(\"saveField\")}}\" > save </button>\n    <button onclick=\"{{action(\"resetField\")}}\" > reset </button>\n  </form>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport {Component} from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport {prop} from \"@slyte/core\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component{\n  data(){\n    return {\n      fieldName : prop(\"string\",{default : \"\",mandatory :  true})\n    }\n  }\n  static actions(){\n    return{\n      resetField : function(){\n        this.setData(\"fieldName\",\"\",{skipValidation : true})\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nfreeze data\n\nTo make the properties defined in the data block immutable(properties can't be changed, added, or deleted), you can use pass the config \"freeze\" as true just like the below code snippet.\n\nIt is to note that on freezing the data properties, such properties cannot be changed during runtime.\n\n```javascript\ndata(){\n  return{\n    sections: prop(\"object\", {\n    \"default\":\n      \t{a : \"apple\", b : \"ball\"};\n        freeze : true;\n      })\n  }\n}\n```\nmany\n\nAn entity of the schema can be associated to multiple entities in another schema with the method many.\n\nParams\t:\tString schemaName, Object options\nReturns\t:\tObject definitionObj\nDesc\t:\tThis method is used to define relationship with another model, stating that the given attribute can hold more than one record, of the related model.\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb } from \"../db.js\";\nimport { prop, many } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Comment } from \"../comment.js\";\nclass Blog extends AppDb.Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      userComment : many( Comment )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Blog };\n```\none\n\nIn an one-to-one relationship, one entity in a schema can be associated with just one entity in another schema.\n\nParams\t:\tString schemaName, Object options\nReturns\t:\tObject definitionObj\nDesc\t:\tThis method is used to define relationship with another model, stating that the given attribute can hold only a single record of the related model.\n```javascript\nimport { AppDb } from \"../db.js\";\nimport { prop, one } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { User } from \"../user.js\";\nclass Profile extends AppDb.Schema{\n  props(){\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" ),\n      name : prop( \"string\" ),\n      user : one( User )\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { Profile };\n```\nresolvePromises\n\nThis method takes an array/object containing promises and resolves them.\n\n```javascript\nimport { resolvePromises } from \"@slyte/core\";\nvar prom = resolvePromises([\n    this.$db.getAll({schema: User}),\n    this.$db.getAll({schema: Module})\n]);\nprom.then( function( data ){\n    // data will contain the array containing the resolved data\n    console.log( data [ 0 ] ); // contains user response\n    console.log( data [ 1 ] ); // contains module response\n},function( error ){\n    // error instance of the first failure\n})\n```\n```javascript\nimport { resolvePromises } from \"@slyte/core\";\nvar prom = resolvePromises({\n    users : this.$db.getAll({schema: User}),\n    modules : this.$db.getAll({schema: Module})\n});\nprom.then( function( data ){\n    // data will contain the resolved object.\n    console.log( data.users );    // contains this.$db.getAll({schema: User}) response\n    console.log( data.modules );  // contains this.$db.getAll({schema: Module}) response\n},function( error ){\n    // error instance of first failure\n})\n```\n\nThis method returns a promise which will be resolved with the data (resolved object / resolved array) on success and would reject with an error of the first failure in case of failure.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

In simple terms, whenever you render a component which has an array in it or you need to perform any manipulation on the array, this.$app.arrayUtils comes handy. You can also import the arrayUtils and use it as follows. These arrayUtils plays an effective role in binding.\n\nNote:\nAssume an array is passed as argument to the helper and u are manipulating array using arrayUtils api, then the helper won't be triggered. If u want to trigger helper, u need to pass additional \"length\" arguments as \"{{helper(array,array.length)}}\". so whenever you are adding or removing a value in the array then the length of the array will be changed and so helper will be triggered.\n\nIt supports the following array manipulations.\n\nInsertAt\nParam\t:\tArray array, \"insertAt\", Number position, element / [element1,

It must be used if the object is used in the template for effective binding. ObjectUtils can be used by importing them just like the below code snippet. You can also use it via this.$app.objectUtils.\n\n```javascript\nimport {objectUtils} from \"@slyte/component\";\n// Will add a key \"module\" with value \"Leads\" to the object\nobjectUtils( object , \"add\" , \"module\" , \"Leads\" )\n```\n```javascript\nimport {objectUtils} from \"@slyte/component\";\n// Will delete the key \"keyToBeDeleted\" of the object\nobjectUtils( object , \"delete\" , \"keyToBeDeleted\" );\n```\n\nNote:\nAssume an object is passed as argument to the helper and you are manipulating object using objectUtils api, then the helper won't be triggered.\n\nset\nParams\t:\tObject object, String paramName, * Value\nReturns\t:\tN/A\nDesc\t:\tUsed for setting a value to a particular key of an object\n\nIn cases where you don't have the reference to component or record (store's record instance) and want to set a value to a specific key of an Object, you can use this method.\n\n```javascript\nimport { set } from \"@slyte/component\";\nset( someObject , \"module\" , \"Leads\" )\n```\n\nThe above code will set the value of \"module\" key of \"someObject\" to \"Leads\" and ensures that the changes are reflected in the components which have used this data.\n\nrender\nParams\t:\tComponent's Class, Object componentData, String querySelector, options\nReturns\t:\tComponent Element (Node)\nDesc\t:\tTo create a component and render it at the outlet specified by the querySelector or append in the node reference\n\nThis method comes handy when you want to render a component. Let us consider an example where CRM registry has multiple instances. If any particular instance is not specified, the first intiaited instance will be taken into consideration by default. Now to make it available in the particular registry, you can use this.$registry.render. Apart from that, you can also pass the registry instance in the options with the keyword \"registryInstance.\"\n\nHave a look at the below code snippet to get a better understanding of render()\n\n```javascript\nrender(\n  componentClass,           // the component you want to render\n  componentData,           // object (props/attributes) for that component\n  outlet,                  // where to render it (a selector or node reference)\n  options                  // optional to define the position such as before,after,prepend,append\n)\n```\nParameters in detail\ncomponentClass - The actual component you want to render.\ndata - The Properties/data passed into the component.\noutlet - The node to render the DOM.\noptions - Define the position such as before, after, prepend, append. While using prepend and append, the framework uses node.prepend api and node.appendchild api. While passing the position, you can also pass the referenceNode such as {position : \"before\", refNode : refNode}\n\nIn the componentClass - provide the component you want to render\n\nLet us look at few examples\n\n```javascript\nimport { render } from \"@slyte/component\";\nimport { WelcomeComponent } from \"./welcome-component.js\";\nlet node = document.querySelector(\"home-comp\");\nlet welcomeCompNode1 = render( welcomeComponent , {\n  \"module\" : \"Leads\",\n  \"list\" : true\n}, node,\n{\n  attributes : [\"attrName1\" , {name : \"attrName2\", value : \"attrValue2\"} ],\n  registryInstance : window.crmreigstryinstance,\n  {methods : {methodName : function(){} ,methodName2 : function(){} }},\n  clearOutlet : true,\n  setInnerHTML: true\n  position : \"after\"\n});\n\n\nlet welcomeCompNode2 = render( welcomeComponent , {\n  \"module\" : \"Leads\",\n  \"list\" : true\n}, \"#outlet\",{position : \"append\"} );\n```\n\nIn the above example, the component \"welcome-component\" will be created and appended to the element(node) or in the outlet.\n\nload component\n\nSlyte autobundles the components, router, datastore of your app by default. But if your app lacks the router, the auto bundling gets interrupted as there will be an improper flow of import statements. In such cases, you can use loadcomponent api. With this, you can download the files and use it with much ease.\n\n```html\nimport {loadComponent} from \"@slyte/core\"\nloadComponent(\"welcome-component\", registryClass);\nloadComponent([\"a-comp\", \"b-comp\"] , registryClass);\nloadComponent([{ name : \"a-comp\" , registry : registryClass1}, { name : \"x-comp\" , registry : registryClass2} ] );\n```\n\nWhile using the loadcomponents, the registryClass has to be mentioned. If the registryClass is not passed, then the welcome-component will be searched only in the default registry.\n\nWith load components, you can pass the following as the first argument\nComponents as string,\nMultiple components as array of string,\nThe component and the registry class as an object.\nand the registry class can be passed as the second argument.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data. We do have a host of other libraries, tools and extensions which ease the app development making it faster to build apps using sLyte.\n\nGit RepoRelease Notes Forum"

While using in a template the camel case must be represented as hyphen values.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-post\">\n    <span> {{title}} </span>\n    <span onclick=\"{{action('editBlog',id, content)}}\"> Edit </span>\n    <span> {{content}} </span>\n    <lyte-menu on-close=\"{{action('onMenuClose')}}\"> </lyte-menu>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"1233\" }),\n      title : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog title\" }),\n      content : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog Content\" })\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      onMenuClose : function(){\n        return false; // will stop onClose event bubbling\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\n\nIn the above code, lyte-menu being the child component, calls the on-close(custom event) and the parent component(blog-post) handles it.\n\nLet's check how to throw a custom event (onClose) from lyte-menu component\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"lyte-menu\">\n   <ul>\n     <template lyte-for=\"{{menuItems}} as item index\">\n       <li onclick=\"{{action(\"closeMenu\")}}\">\n       \"{{menuItems}}\"\n       </li>\n     </template>\n   </ul>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass LyteMenu extends Component {\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      closeMenu : function() {\n        this.throwEvent( \"on-close\" ); // Throws onClose event\n        return false;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {LyteMenu};\n```\n\nIt is not mandated to explicitly specify listeners for custom events. If the parent contains onClose action and if the event is not stopped explicitly the same gets invoked.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"blog-Post\">\n    <span> {{title}} </span>\n    <span onclick=\"{{action('editBlog',id, content)}}\"> Edit </span>\n    <span> {{content}} </span>\n    <lyte-menu> </lyte-menu>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass BlogPost extends Component {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      id : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"1233\" }),\n      title : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog title\" }),\n      content : prop( \"string\" , { \"default\" : \"Blog Content\" })\n    }\n  }\n  static actions() {\n    return {\n      onClose : function(){\n        return false; // will stop onClose event bubbling\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport {BlogPost};\n```\n\n\nexecuteMethod\n\nHave a look at the below code snippet.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"user-component\">\n    <lyte-menu on-before-show={{method('onBeforeShow')}}> </lyte-menu>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass UserComponent extends Component {\n    static methods() {\n        return {\n            \"onBeforeShow\" : function(){\n                console.log( this );\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nexport {UserComponent};\n```\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"lyte-menu\">\n    <ul>\n     <template lyte-for=\"{{menuItems}} as menuItem index\"\n             <li> {{menuItem}} </li>\n         </template>\n    </ul>\n</template>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass LyteMenu extends Component {\n  init() {\n     var retValue = this.executeMethod( \"onBeforeShow\" );\n     if(retValue) {\n       // Do something\n     } else {\n       // Do something else\n     }\n  }\n}\nexport {LyteMenu};\n```\n\nHere the method 'onBeforeShow' is passed from the parent component(UserComp) to the child component(lyte-menu). So that the child component can execute the method via executeMethod api. This method will be executed in parent component's context.\n\nIn short, The method that is been passed from the parent component to the child component is executed with execute method.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Customizing Serializer\nSerializer\n\nSerializer is a callback layer where the request and the response data can be modified and configured before being sent and received from the server. By default Data store supports RESTSerializer and GraphqlSerializer, which support REST and Graphql standards respectively.\n\nGenerate Using CLI\n\nTo generate a serializer using CLI, use the following command.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate serializer user\n```\nSkeleton\n\nOn creating a serializer, you can find the class serializer. Have a look at the below code snippet to find out the available call backs. You can pass the required arguments based on your needs. Keep reading to understand the needs and importance of these callbacks..\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass UserSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({schemaName, type, payLoad, key, status, headers, queryParams, customData, opts }){\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n  serializePayload({type , data ,cachedData, customData, schemaName, queryParams, actionName}){\n    return data;\n  }\n  serializeKey({schemaName, type, customData, queryParams}){\n  }\n  getMeta({payLoad, schemaName, type, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  }\n  normalizeKey({schemaName, type, key, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  }\n  serializeEntity({entityData, schemaName, customData, url, type, queryParams, method, headers, withCredentials}){\n    var urlObj = {url:url, type:type, qP:queryParams, method:method, headers, headers, withCredentials:withCredentials};\n    return entityData;\n  }\n  normalizeEntity({entityPayload, schemaName, customData, url, type, queryParams, method, headers, withCredentials}){\n    var urlObj = {url:url, type:type, qP:queryParams, method:method, headers, headers, withCredentials:withCredentials};\n    return entityPayload;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { GraphqlSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass UserSerializer extends GraphqlSerializer{\n  serializeGqlQuery({gqlObj}){\n    return gqlObj\n  }\n  serializeSelfQuery({selfGqlObj}){\n    return selfGqlObj;\n  }\n  normalizePayload({schemaName, type, payLoad, key, status, headers, queryParams, customData, opts }){\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n  serializePayload({type , data ,cachedData, customData, schemaName, queryParams, actionName}){\n    return data;\n  }\n  serializeKey({schemaName, type, customData, queryParams}){\n  }\n  getMeta({payLoad, schemaName, type, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  }\n  normalizeKey({schemaName, type, key, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  }\n  serializeEntity({entityData, cachedData, schemaName, customData, url, type, queryParams, method, headers, withCredentials}){\n    var urlObj = {url:url, type:type, qP:queryParams, method:method, headers, headers, withCredentials:withCredentials};\n    return entityData;\n  }\n  normalizeEntity({entityPayload, schemaName, customData, url, type, queryParams, method, headers, withCredentials}){\n    var urlObj = {url:url, type:type, qP:queryParams, method:method, headers, headers, withCredentials:withCredentials};\n    return entityPayload;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nAdding to Schema\n\nIn the schema class, the serializer class can be added either in the static Serializer variable or can be returned in static Serializer method as below.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { UserSerializer } from \"../serializers/user\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  static Serializer = UserSerializer;\n  props(){\n    return {\n      str: prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Schema } from \"@slyte/data\";\nimport { UserSerializer } from \"../serializers/user\";\nimport { UserGqlSerializer } from \"../serializers/gql/user\";\nclass User extends Schema{\n  static Serializer({type}){\n    if(type == \"updateEntity\"){\n      return UserGqlSerializer;\n    }\n    return UserSerializer;\n  }\n  props(){\n    return {\n      str: prop(\"string\")\n    }\n  }\n}\nexport { User };\n```\nCallback Arguments\n\nAs mentioned above, you can pass the required arguments inside the object notation of the callbacks. Below is list of arguments along with its properties.\n\nProperties and its details\nREST\nGraphql\ntype - type of method, which triggered the request( possible values - get / update / updateRecord / create / createRecord / delete / deleteRecord / destroyRecord / action )\nschemaName - name of the schema\nqueryParams - queryParams of the request\ndata - request data of the request\nentityData - request data of a single entity\npayLoad - response payLoad of the request\nentityPayload - response payLoad of a single entity\nopts - extra option of the method, which triggered the request\nmethod - method of the request(GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE)\nkey - primaryKey value of the entity\nhost - url host\nheaders - headers of the request\ncustomData - customData passed in the method\ncallback - callback name\ncachedData - cached entities\nactionName - name of the action defined in model\nxhr - XMLHTTPRequest object\n\nIf just one property is required for a callback, it can be destructured like below\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({payLoad}){\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nExpected Response Structure\n\nFor all types of request, datastore will expect the response in a specific format. It should be an object which can have two keys, one with schemaName value as the key which has the payload data as value and other with meta key which has the meta information of the request.\n\n[schemaName] : [Response data]\n\"meta\" : [meta information]\n\nConsider for the schema with name \"user\", following structure will be expected.\n\n```javascript\n{\n        \"user\" : { } /  [  ] ,\n        \"meta\" : Some meta information which can be of any type ( Optional )\n}\n```\nStructuring a Serializer\n\nIdeal way is to have an application serializer as the base serializer for the db. It is good to mention the same in the db. This should extend either RESTSerializer / GraphqlSerializer. All the schema specific connectors, should extend this application connector.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Db, RESTConnector, RESTSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass AppDb extends Db{\nstatic Serializer = GraphQL;\n}\nexport { AppDb };\n```\n\nBelow is an example for RESTSerializer.\n\n```javascript\nimport { RESTSerializer } from \"@slyte/data\";\nclass ApplicationSerializer extends RESTSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({type, queryParams, payLoad}){\n        return payLoad;\n      }\n}\nexport { ApplicationSerializer };\n```\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({payLoad}){\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nUsage\nModify the response - from server\n\nResponse received from the server, will be expected in some format by the data store. Check expected response structure before it is given to data store, if it is not in the format as the data store expects, then it can be modified in normalizePayload or normalizeEntity callbacks as per the needs.\n\nFirst entire response will be received in normalizePayload callback. And you can use normalizeEntity callback to call each data entity object.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  normalizeEntity({schemaName, type, entityPayload, customData, opts}){\n    entityPayload.fromServer = true;\n    return entityPayload;\n  }\n  normalizePayload({schemaName, type, payLoad, key, xhr, headers, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n    payLoad[ schemaName ].sort( function( a , b ){ return a.id > b.id })\n    return payLoad;\n  }\n});\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nModify the payload - to server\n\nBefore a request data is sent to server, serializeEntity callback will be called for each entity object that is being sent to server. Then the entire payload will be recevied in serialize callback, where the request serializePayload structure can be modified, if needed.\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  serializeEntity({schemaName, type, entityData, customData, opts}){\n    return entityData;\n  }\n  serializePayload({schemaName, type, data, key, xhr, headers, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n    return data;\n  }\n});\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nDetermine the payLoad data key\n\nIf the schema data is received in some other key other than its schemaName key, then you can specify the key for which the schema data is received, in normalizeKey callback in the serializer.\n\n```javascript\nnormalizeKey({schemaName , type , key , queryParams , customData, opts}){\n  return \"data\";\n}\n```\nDetermine the metadata for the request\n\nIn simple terms, Metadata is some additional information about the request.\nsuch pageno, perpage etc.,\n\nMetadata can be returned for a request in the serializer callback getMeta .\n\n```javascript\ngetMeta({payLoad, schemaName, type, queryParams, customData, opts}){\n  return payLoad.meta;\n}\n```\nMethod for calling parent serializer callbacks\n\nUsing super, parent serializer callbacks can be called. Arguments can be called like below\n\n```javascript\nimport { ApplicationSerializer } from \"./application\";\nclass UserSerializer extends ApplicationSerializer{\n  normalizePayload({payLoad}){\n    return super.normalizePayload(..arguments);\n  }\n}\nexport { UserSerializer };\n```\nCustomizing GraphqSerializer\nConfigure / modify the base graphql query\n\nThe query which is sent to the server can be configured or customized in serializeGqlQuery. In serializeGqlQuery, entire query with its variables will be received as an argument in gqlObj, which can be modified if required and returned.\n\n```javascript\nserializeGqlQuery({type, gqlObj}){\n  if(type !== \"deleteEntity\" || type !== \"delete\"){\n      gqlObj.variables={insert_Data:gqlObj.data}\n  }\n  else{\n      gqlObj.variables={delete_data:gqlObj.data}\n  }\n  return gqlObj;\n}\n```\n\nHere, in this query gglObj and in its callback, an object gets returned with the following keys,\n\ntype - Query or Mutation\nquery - query in object structure\nmutation - query in object structure\nvariables - variables of query\nqueryType - default or namedQuery or query\nqueryName - query name (for namedQuery)\nmutationType - default or namedMutation or customMutation\nmutationName - mutation name (for namedMutation)\nConfigure / modify any self graphql query\n\nTo serialize any query either for the parent schema or relation schema, serializeSelfQuery callback can be used. In simple terms, this can be used for the nested or the parent model.\n\nExample: If we make a query for user(parent) and the profile as child, then for user, user serializer's serializeSelfQuery gets called and for profile, the profile serializer's serializeSelfQuery get called.\n\n```javascript\nserializeSelfQuery({type, selfGqlObj}){\n  return selfGqlObj.query;\n}\n```\n\nHere, in this query selfGqlobj and in its callback an object gets returned with the following keys,\n\nquery - properties of that schema in array structure\nvariables - variables of the query as object\n\nHere, It returns the subfields(array) for the given call backs.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Command Line Interface(CLI)\n\nCLI helps you manage your sLyte applications with ease, from your local machine. Using CLI, you can perform various operations in your sLyte application with simple commands. You can create, build, and run your applications, as well as generate files, minify and concatenate lyte files, and more.\n\nInstallation of CLI\n\nThe CLI is published as an npm package in the cm-npmregistry. To install the CLI, refer to the installation procedures specified in the Quick Start Section.\n\nFunctionality of CLI\n\nThe functions of CLI can be broadly categorized as follows:\n\nApplication creation\nFiles generation\nApplication Build\nAsset management\nCSS Assets Handling\nApplication Layout\nApplication creation\n\nYou can create a new application in sLyte using CLI in the directory of your choice. You can integrate your application with lyte using npm.\n\nFiles generation\n\nCLI provides commands to generate routes, components, helpers, mixins, schemas and more. You can generate these files using the lyte generate command. You can delete files created using the lyte generate command by using the lyte destroy command.\n\nApplication Build\n\nWith CLI, you can compile routes, models, components, and other generated files. You can define your own build configurations for the application. Just start the sLyte server in a specific port, and perform several other actions with CLI.\n\nAsset Management\n\nAsset management involves all operations that are performed on the sLyte application. These operations include bundling.\n\nCLI uses webpack for bundling all the dependent files. Webpack is a static module bundler that bundles the javascript file based on one or more entry points and builds a dependency graph based on the entry points.\n\nIn the sLyte applications the entry point will be configured in lyte.config.js\n\nEntry points\n\nCLI gives you an option to define the entry point of your application. This entry point would serve as a starting point for your application to build the dependency graph.\n\n```javascript\nlet path = require(\"path\");\n module.exports = function() {\n     return {\n         initialFileToLoad : path.join(process.cwd(),\"app-init.js\"),\n\n         // entry : {\n             // key : Array of values\n         // }\n         // Eg : entry : {\n         //     \"components/todo.js\" : [\"components/javascript/todo-item.js\",\"components/javascript/todo-modal.js\"]\n         // }\n\n     }\n }\n```\n\nIf the entry point is not provided, CLI takes app-init.js as its entry point and builds the dependency graph.\n\n```javascript\nimport {LyteblogApp} from \"./app.js\";\n\nvar app = new LyteblogApp({\n    performance : true,\n    debug : true\n});\n\nexport {app};\n```\nCustom plugins\n\nCLI, allows you to optimise your bundle based on the corresponding plugin. Based on your need, you can choose the plugin and require it in lyte.config.js just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nlet path = require(\"path\");\nconst MonacoWebpackPlugin = require(\"monaco-editor-webpack-plugin\");\nmodule.exports = function() {\n    return {\n        initialFileToLoad : path.join(process.cwd(),\"app-init.js\"),\n        plugins: [\n            new MonacoWebpackPlugin({\n                languages: ['typescript', 'javascript', 'css', 'html', 'json'],\n                filename : \"/node_modules/@slyte/lyte-editor/dist/workers/[name].worker.js\"\n            })\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\nCSS Assets Handling\n\nsLyte cli has internally handled the relative urls to smoothen the assets download from css files. This is done automatically by updating the asset paths in your CSS and SCSS files during CLI processing. It ensures that the asset references point to the correct dist locations and handles both absolute and relative paths seamlessly.\n\nAbsolute path\n\nLet us consider an example, where you can give the absolute path. This path stays as an absolute path, rooted at the dist. Let us consider an example\n\n```javascript\nbody {\n background-image:url(\"/path/to/asset\");\n}\n```\n\nThe CLI takes the given absolute path rooted at the dist folder.\n\n```javascript\nbody {\n  background-image:url(\"/path/to/asset\");\n}\n```\n\nThere are cases where the absolute paths are given in the below structure.\n\n```javascript\nbody {\n  background-image: url(\"path/to/asset\");\n}\n```\n\nIn such cases, the absolute path will be converted to a relative path with respect to the output file's location within the dist directory just like below\n\n```javascript\nbody {\n background-image: url(\"../../path/to/asset\");\n}\n```\nRelative path\n\nIf the relative path is given, it gets adjusted to reflect the dist structure.\n\n```javascript\nbody {\n background-image: url(\"../../path/to/asset\");\n}\n```\n\nThe CLI takes the path from the dist just like the below code snippet\n\n```javascript\nbody {\n background-image: url(\"../../path/to/asset\");\n}\n```\n\nIn production, fingerprints are appended to asset filenames just like the below code snippet.\n```javascript\nbody {\n    background-image: url(\"../../path/to/asset-123456.png\");\n}\n```\n\nApplication Layout\n\nUsing CLI, you can define a default directory structure for all files in your lyte application. The organization of all the files of your application is represented in the directory structure, which makes it easier for you to navigate through any sLyte application.\n\nView the complete list of CLI commands here.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Introduction\nIntroduction\n\nLyte-dom is an extremely light weight javascript library which provides utilities for DOM traversal, event handling and ajax requests. Lyte-dom comes in modules split according to the tasks they achieve, so developers can import their module of choice and leave the others out allowing you to ship an extremely light weight third party to your production site.\n\nGetting started\n\nYou can download the latest lyte-dom zip from here. If you use bower, add it to the dependency list as follows. Example:\n\nrouter.js\n{ \n\n\t\t...\n\n\t\t\"dependencies\" : { \n\n\t\t\t\t\"@zoho/lyte-dom\" : '2.0.23',\n\n\t\t\t\t...\n\n\t\t }\n\n\t\t...\n\n }\n\nAs mentioned above, you can import the module of your choice into your app and get started. There are 4 modules in lyte-dom. They are\n\nutils.js\nThis registers lyte-dom to your app and provides query selecting and basic functions like each, grep, map, merge, fastdom, etc. This file needs to be added to your app for the other modules to work.( Mandatory ) - 6 kb\ntraversal.js\nProvides functionalities for advanced traversal like parentsUntil, siblings, etc. ( Optional ) - 6 kb\nevents.js\nProvides functionalities for event handling, event delegation, etc. ( Optional ) - 6 kb\najax.js\nProvides functionalities to make an ajax request ( Optional ) - 6 kb\n\nOnly the utils.js is mandatory which makes basic registration. Other modules can be added based on user preference.\nThe folder structure of lyte-ui-components is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nlyte-DOM/\n\nlyte-dom-migrate.js\n\nlyte-dom-migrate.min.js\n\nlyte-dom.js\n\nlyte-dom.min.js\n\nmodules/\n\nlyte-dom-ajax.js\n\nlyte-dom-events.js\n\nlyte-dom-traversal.js\n\nlyte-dom-utils.js\n\nlyte-dom-ajax.min.js\n\nlyte-dom-events.min.js\n\nlyte-dom-traversal.min.js\n\nlyte-dom-utils.min.js\n\nSimple overview\n\nQuery select any element in the DOM by making use of the lyte-dom's query selector syntax. The following example retrieves all inputs of type checkbox which are checked.\n\n$L('input[type=\"checkbox\"]:checked');\n\nMake use of chaining to perform dom traversals and write less verbose code. The following example demonstrates chaining where all checkboxes which are checked are queried and the closest parent tag of type lyte-checkbox is selected. From there all next siblings until lyte-checkbox are retrieved.\n\n$L('input[type=\"checkbox\"]:checked').closest ('lyte-checkbox').nextUntil ('lyte-checkbox');\n\nRegister events with lyte-dom with ease. In the following example, a click event is bound to all elements with class clickable.\n\n$L('.clickable').on ('click',function (){ \n\n\t\t // Perform your operation over here\n\n });\n\nPerform ajax requests. Following example makes an ajax request to /users and converts the response to type json and is further processed in the success callback.\n\n$L.ajax({ \n\n\t\t'url' : '/users',\n\n\t\t'dataType' : 'json',\n\n\t\t'success' : function (res ){ \n\n\t\t\t\t // work with response\n\n\t\t }\n\n });\n\nClick this link to download the latest version of Lyte-DOM and check out the release notes before using it\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Installing UI Components for sLyte Application\n\nIntergrating UI components to your sLyte application is just a step away. Follow the below steps and get it installed in a jiffy.\n\nPrerequisities\n\nIt is vital to install CLI, Node.js and npm in your machine. Before proceeding further, we assume that you are acquainted with HTML, CSS, JS and sLyte\n\nThese are the neceessary dependency versions you want to install before using UI Components\n\n@slyte/cli : 1.0.0\n\n@slyte/core : 1.0.0\n\n@zoho/lyte-dom : 2.0.225\n\n@zoho/lyte-ui-component: 4.1.13\n\nCreating an app in sLyte\n\nLet us first create an app to test our components inside it. The installation of UI Components follows a similar pattern in case you are trying to install it in your main project.\n\n```html\nlyte new dummy-app\n```\n\nRunning the above command creates a sLyte-app named as dummy-app in the place where you ran it. Move into the newly created sLyte-app.\n\n```html\ncd dummy-app\n```\n\nNow open the package.json file inside the app. You will find something similar to the below image.\n\nInstalling Addons\n\nThe following command will help you to install addons to your existing sLyte application. Only through the addons, UI components can be installed in your application.\n\n```html\nlyte install <package> <options> --registry\n```\n\nIn the package field, provide the package you wish to install and in the options field, mention the version you wish to install and in the registry field, specify the registry you wish to install just like the below code.\n```html\nlyte install @zoho/lyte-ui-component@4.1.13 --registry http://cm-npmregistry\n```\nHere are few more examples.\n\nNow, after intergrating the UI Components as addons, you can find the following changes in the package.json.\n\nBy default, on executing the above command, you can find LyteUiComponentAddon as lookups, being added in app.js just like the below image.\n\nYou can also find the instance of UI Components in component.js just like the below image.\n\nIncluding CSS Dependencies\n\nIf you are using a particular component then you need to include the css dependency for that particular component in index.html of your application.\n\nFor clear understanding refer the snippet given below.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"app-init.js\"></script>\n\n<!-- lyte button css files -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-button.css\" />\n<!-- Each component usually has an associated CSS file-->\n<!-- files end-->\n```\n\nIf you are using more components in your application. It is very hard for the developer to include the css dependency of the each and every file.\n\nInstead of including each component's dependency seperately, you can include lyte-ui-components.css which includes all the css dependencies of the UI components.\n\n```html\n<!-- All css files -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-components.css\" />\n<!-- files end-->\n```\nIncluding i18n Dependencies\n\nGet the text provided by the UI components internationalized with the help of i18n files.\n\nTo do so include the following dependencies.\n\n```html\n<!-- i18n files -->\n<script src=\"/node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/I18n/en_US.js\"></script>\n<!-- files end-->\n```\n\nNow, let's navigate to learn about passing the properties and callbacks to UI components\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Things To know\nProperties and Configuration\n\nProperties in UI Components are prefixed with lt-prop. For example, the value property in a radiobutton is lt-prop-value. Here's how you pass properties to UI components.\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-name=\"radio-group\" lt-prop-value=\"shipping\" lt-prop-label=\"Shipping\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\n\nYou can also get and set lt-prop attributes in UI Components through your javascript. You need to querySelect your component and invoke the .ltProp() function on them.\n\nThis demonstrates a getter function.\n\n```javascript\nvar value = document.querySelector('lyte-radiobutton').ltProp('value');\n```\n\nThis demonstrates a setter function.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector('lyte-radiobutton').ltProp('value' , 'COD');\n```\nCallbacks\n\nUI Components provides callbacks for you to work with. They are usually invoked in response to an action performed on a component. These callbacks depends on the method behaviour of the sLyte component. For example, the 'on-before-checked' callback of a checkbox is invoked everytime when a checkbox moves to before checked state.\n\nYou can also use the callback to set data, make a XMLHttpRequest, trigger an animation, etc. Apart from that there are many other callbacks to make your process easier. This callback is usually written in the js file of the component inside which you have invoked the UI Component. For example, if you have used lyte-checkbox in your welcome-comp.html then the definition of the callback is written in the welcome-comp.js file. Here's an example.\n\n```html\n<lyte-checkbox on-checked={{method(\"makeRequest\")}} lt-prop-appearance=\"failure\"></lyte-checkbox>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\nconstructor() {\n    super();\n}\ndata() {\n    return {\n\n    }\n}\nstatic methods() {\n    return{\n        makeRequest : function(){\n            // Make a request\n        }\n    }\n }\n}\nexport { UserComp };\n```\n\nIn the cases were the methods could not be statically defined in the conponent's js, you can use the .setMethods() to register callbacks dynamically.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-checkbox' ).setMethods({\n    onChecked : function(){\n        // Do stuff\n    }\n});\n```\n\nDevelopers generally use .setMethods() when they are not using slyte's templating system or when they have rendered the component through script( registry.render or document.createElement to create the component).\n\nAs you can tell, the callbacks in UI Components are methods. To get an elaborate overview of methods, visit the following link.\n\nYield\n\nBy far, Yield is the most important concept of UI Components. It is highly recommended to learn about yield before trying to use UI Component's yield.\n\nHere's a quick overview of what it is. Suppose you want to create a button component for your app. Now on taking a note on the visual for buttons in your app, you find that there are 15 variations of buttons in all. Now, you as a developer, need to come up with a way to create a button component that encompasses all these 15 variations.\n\nOne way to do it is to create a type attribute in your button component and based on the value of the type you render different buttons by making use of a switch. This doesn't help because new buttons types will come further down the road and this forces you to keep increasing the size of your button component. In the end, you ship a massive button component at the start of your app and most of the button types might be used in some corner of the website which the user might not even visit.\n\nIn such cases, you can create a button component just to cover the cases that occurs the most and achieve other customizations through yield. In the above example, you achieve the first 4 types by making use of a type attribute and you achieve the icon types through yield. Here's a definition of your button component.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"button-comp\">\n    <% if( type == 'default' ){ %>\n        <button class=\"default\">\n            {{content}}\n        </button>\n    <% }elseif(type=='primary'){ %>\n        <button class=\"primary\">\n            {{content}}\n        </button>\n    <% } else if( type == 'success' ){ %>\n        <button class=\"success\">\n            {{content}}\n        </button>\n    <% } else if( type == 'success-outlined' ){ %>\n        <button class=\"success-outlined\">\n            {{content}}\n        </button>\n    <% } else if( type == 'yield' ) { %>\n        <button class={{classVal}} style={{styleVal}}>\n            <lyte-yield yield-name=\"yield\"> </lyte-yield>\n        </button>\n    <% } %>\n</template>\n```\n\nTo create the archive button using yield, you would invoke the component as follows.\n\n```html\n<button-comp type='yield' style-val='background-color: black;'>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <i class=\"mR3 fas fa-archive\"> </i>\n        <span class=\"borderLeft\"> Archive </span>\n    </template>\n</button-comp>\n```\n\nWhen the button-comp is invoked as above, the content inside the template tag in the invocation is appended to the lyte-yield tag in the button-comp.html file and rendered. With the style-val attribute set to background-color black, you can achieve an archive button.\n\nThe yield is at the core of most UI Components. Most UI Components define a skeletal outer layer and allows you to input your own DOM content into it. The lyte-modal allows you to add DOM content to its body, the lyte-button allows you to add content to a button's innerHTML, etc.\n\nHere's a simple example of a lyte-calender using an yield. The lyte-calendar renders a calendar widget, but also allows you to add your own DOM content to its footer. Here's how its achieved.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"footer\">\n        <div style=\"padding: 5px 0px 5px 15px;\">\n            <a> Day </a>\n            <a> Week </a>\n            <a> Month </a>\n        </div>\n    </template>\n</lyte-calendar>\n```\n\nRemember you can add your own DOM elements, styles and bind functions to the yielded content. Here's an example demonstrating binding a function to the lyte-dropdown's header tag.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-header>\n                <span class=\"content\" onclick={{action('doStuff')}}>\n                    Add More\n                </span>\n            </lyte-drop-header>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='1'> Option 1 </lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='2'> Option 2 </lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='3'> Option 3 </lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='4'> Option 4 </lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n    return{\n       doStuff : function(){\n          // Make a request\n       }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, everything inside the yield is the container which opens when a dropdown is clicked. An action is bound to the header and it can be handled in the parent component.\n\nThemeing\n\nThe themeing module in UI Components uses the Less framework. The css is defined as variables or as mixins. sLyte application can customize the Less variables or mixins to make the UI component's visual to sync with your app's visual. More on themeing over here.\n\nSome of the UI components require i18n files to work. The default text provided by the UI components can be internationalized by importing the i18n files of the language currently being used in the website. It is also important to note that Only the text used by UI components by default can be internationalized. It should be noted that if you are using your own text in UI components, such texts can't be internationalized. You can learn more about Internationalization here\n\nNow let's navigate to learn about how to work with the UI components in general.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Working with UI components\n\nThis documentation will detail some of the things that developers need to remember while using UI components.\n\nInspect the component\n\nWhatever component you are using, it is always a good idea to open the inspector panel to find out what elements are getting rendered when the component renders. This will help you understand some of the attributes associated with the UI Components and also give you an idea about what CSS rule to change when you want to style the component according to your needs.\n\nChanging CSS\n\nAlmost all the time, people using UI Components would want to style the components in a way that fits their app. There are a number of ways to style UI Components in sLyte and let us have a look at them.\n\nLets take the example of lyte-button, which requires the border-radius of lyte-button to be 3px. This is how we would do it.\n\nFirst inspect lyte-button and find out which style is being applied for the border-radius property of the button element rendered inside. In our case, it is the following style.\n\n```css\nlyte-button button {\n    border-radius: 2px;\n    font-size: 15px;\n    padding: 5px 15px;\n    font-family: 'LatoRegular', 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    outline: none;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    border-style: solid;\n}\n```\n\nThe above style can be found inside the dist/node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-button.css\n\nTo change the border-radius of the button, just use the same CSS rule and add your new border radius.\n\n```css\nlyte-button button {\n    border-radius: 3px;\n}\n```\n\nNow this style will be contained in another CSS file. Just make sure this file is loaded after the ui-components/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-button.css file. Since the browser follows source order when deciding the styles for an element, the style added last(which is the new style we created) will be used as the border-radius for the button.\n\nAnother way to change the style of the button is by writing styles with more specific CSS selectors. In the example above, we could add a class to the lyte button element and write a CSS rule based on that class.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button class=\"some-class\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        Secondary\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n```css\n.some-class button {\n    border-radius: 3px;\n}\n```\n\nA third way to do this is using UI Components themeing system. This will be explained in the Themes section.\n\nSetting Attributes\n\nYou can set the usual HTML attributes on UI Components that you would normally set on other HTML elements.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button id=\"someid\" lt-prop-appearance=\"secondary\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        Secondary\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n\nYou can later query these elements in your javascript code as follows.\n\n```javascript\nvar button = document.querySelector( '#someid' );\n```\nCommon Utils\n\nA common utility function that is available on all UI Components is the .ltProp() function. You can use this function to either get or set an attribute as follows. To use this util, you need a reference to the component element.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button id=\"someid\" lt-prop-appearance=\"failure\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        Failure\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n\nFor the above button, you can get or set the lt-prop-background-color attribute using .ltProp() function as follows.\n\n```javascript\nvar button = document.getElementById( 'someid' );\nvar color = button.ltProp( 'backgroundColor' ); // Getter\nbutton.ltProp( 'backgroundColor', 'red' ); // Setter\n```\n\nIt can be seen that the background-color is passed in the camel case form: backgroundColor\n\nRegistering Defaults\n\nLets say, your team decides that every lyte-button rendered in your app must render as a primary button. One way to do this is to pass the lt-prop-apperance attribute of the button as primary. While this can be done, developers might sometimes find themselves missing the attribute. In complex examples where 4-5 attributes have to be passed, then it could lead to inconsistencies in the UI.\n\nA way around this is to use the registerDefaultValues util. The example below demonstrates the use of registerDefaultValues on lyte-button.\n\n```javascript\n_lyteUiUtils.registerDefaultValues( {\n    'lyte-button': {\n    'size': 'large',\n    'backgroundColor': 'red',\n    'appearance': 'primary'\n    }\n} );\n```\n\nNow lyte-buttons rendered by default will have lt-prop-size as large, lt-prop-background-color as red and lt-prop-type as primary.\n\nSprites\n\nUI Components uses a sprite file to display icons in some of the components. The sprite file can be found under the node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/theme/images/ folder and is used in CSS properties like background-image. Make sure the path used in the CSS points to location of the sprite resource.\n\nLet's navigate to learn about the popular callbacks\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

This callback comes into picture when a component shows or opens.

This callback gets executed when a component hides or closes.\n\nonSelect or onChanged\n\nonSelect or onChanged, runs when a value in a menu or dropdown is selected or when a checkbox or radio button is changed or a nav item is selected.\n\nBefore Callback\n\nYou will find that some of the UI Components in sLyte will have a callback which is prefixed with on-before or before. You can return false from these callbacks to prevent the component from completing an action it would otherwise normally complete.\n\nReturning false from on-before-open in accordion will prevent the accordion from opening.\n\n```javascript\nstatic methods() {\n     onBeforeOpen: function() {\n         return false; // prevents accordion from opening.\n     }\n}\n```\n\nLet's navigate to learn about layouts.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

Each panel consists of the lyte-accordion-item, lyte-accordion-header and lyte-accordion-body. The lyte-accordion-header is used to specify the header content of the accordion and the lyte-accordion-body is used to specify the body content. Adding the lyteAccordionActive class to the lyte-accordion-item renders that particular panel in an open state. In the above example, the first item has the lyteAccordionActive class.\n\nFeatures\n\nHave a look at the standout features of Lyte Accordion.\n\nConfigurable Accordion\n```html\n<lyte-accordion lt-prop-duration=\"1s\" lt-prop-height=\"80px\">\n  <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n    <lyte-accordion-item class=\"lyteAccordionActive\">\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 1\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body style=\"height: 40px;\"> <!-- set inline height for the accordion.

The lt-prop-height attribute sets the height of each lyte-accordion-body when it is opened and the lt-prop-duration sets the duration to open or close the panel. Setting any inline height to the lyte-accordion-body overrides the lt-prop-height attribute and the content panel opens only to that particular height. If the lt-prop-height and the inline height are not provided, then the accordion calculates the height of its content on render and uses that height to open the accordion.\n\nIn the above example, the lyte-accordion-body of the first lyte-accordion-item has style of height 40px. So this panel opens to 40px whereas the others open to the full 80px.\n\nYou can also force the accordion to calculate the height of the body each time it is opened by setting the lt-prop-dynamic attribute to true.\n\nCustom Accordion\n```html\n<lyte-accordion>\n  <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header class=\"blockStyle\">\n        Accordion 1\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body class=\"panel\">\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n        consectetur adipisicing elit,\n        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n        Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header class=\"blockStyle\">\n        Accordion 2\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body class=\"panel\">\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n        consectetur adipisicing elit,\n        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n        Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header class=\"blockStyle\">\n        Accordion 3\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body class=\"panel\">\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n        consectetur adipisicing elit,\n        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n        Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodoconsequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header class=\"blockStyle\">\n        Accordion 4\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body class=\"panel\">\n          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n          consectetur adipisicing elit,\n          sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n          Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n          quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodconsequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n  </template>\n</lyte-accordion>\n```\n```CSS\n.blockStyle lyte-accordion-header {\n    background-color: #4285f4;\n    color: #fff;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    text-align: left;\n    outline: none;\n    font-size: 15px;\n}\n\n.panel {\n    background-color: white;\n}\n\n.blockStyle .lyteAccordionArrow {\n    border-bottom-color: white;\n    border-right-color: white;\n}\n```\n\nA custom accordion renders with its own styles. The classes blockStyle and panel are used to change the styles of the accordion.\n\nOpen Accordion\n\nA content panel can also be opened when the accordion renders by adding a class (lyteAccordionActive) to the lyte-accordion-item. Content panels that are open have the lyteAccordionActive class set to them.\n\n```html\n<lyte-accordion>\n  <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 1\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body>\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n        consectetur adipisicing elit,\n        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n        Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 2\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body>\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n        consectetur adipisicing elit,\n        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n        Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n    <lyte-accordion-item class=\"lyteAccordionActive\">\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 3\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body>\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n        consectetur adipisicing elit,\n        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n        Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodoconsequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 4\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body>\n          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n          consectetur adipisicing elit,\n          sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n          Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n          quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodconsequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n  </template>\n</lyte-accordion>\n```\nNon Exclusive Accordion\n\nA non-exclusive accordion is one where multiple content panels can be opened at the same time. It is achieved by setting the lt-prop-exclusive attribute to false . You can add lyteAccordionActive to multiple lyte-accordion-item tags to open multiple content panels on render.\n\n```html\n<lyte-accordion lt-prop-exclusive=\"false\">\n  <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 1\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n

</lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n  </template>\n</lyte-accordion>\n```\nPreventing An Accordion From Opening Or Closing\n\nYou can prevent an accordion from opening or closing by returning false from either the onBeforeOpen or the onBeforeClose method.\n\n```html\n<lyte-accordion on-before-open={{method(\"preventOpen\")}}>\n  <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 1\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n

}\n}\n```\nPreventing An Accordion From Opening Or Closing\n\nYou can prevent an accordion from opening or closing by returning false from either the onBeforeOpen or the onBeforeClose method.\n\n```html\n<lyte-accordion on-before-open={{method(\"preventOpen\")}}>\n  <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n

methods()  {\n  return{\n    preventOpen : function(){\n    // do stuff\n    return false;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nAccordion Scrolling To Reveal Content\n\nThe lyte-accordion has the ability to reveal overflowed content by scrolling to it when an item is opened. This is only possible when the lyte-accordion tag has a height set to it(with overflow and position css properties like the example), preventing the content from being displayed.\n\n```html\n<lyte-accordion style=\"position: relative; height: 200px; overflow: scroll;\" lt-prop-exclusive=\"false\">\n  <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 1\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body>\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n        consectetur adipisicing elit,\n        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n        Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 2\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body>\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n        consectetur adipisicing elit,\n        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n        Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 3\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body>\n        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n        consectetur adipisicing elit,\n        sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n        Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n        quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodoconsequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n    <lyte-accordion-item>\n      <lyte-accordion-header>\n        Accordion 4\n        <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n      </lyte-accordion-header>\n      <lyte-accordion-body>\n          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n          consectetur adipisicing elit,\n          sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n          Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n          quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodconsequat.\n      </lyte-accordion-body>\n    </lyte-accordion-item>\n  </template>\n</lyte-accordion>\n```\nAdding/Removing New Items\n\nYou can also add/remove new items into the accordion after the accordion is rendered. Add/remove items into the items(in the above example) array to add/remove accordion items.\n\n```html\n<lyte-accordion>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <% items.forEach(function(item,index){ %>\n            <lyte-accordion-item>\n                <lyte-accordion-header>\n                    Accordion Header\n                    <lyte-icon class=\"lyteAccordionArrow\"></lyte-icon>\n                </lyte-accordion-header>\n                <lyte-accordion-body>\n                    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,\n                    consectetur adipisicing elit,\n                    sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.\n                    Ut enim ad minim veniam,\n                    quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.\n                </lyte-accordion-body>\n            </lyte-accordion-item>\n        <% } ) %>\n    </template>\n</lyte-accordion>\n<lyte-button onclick={{action(\"addItem\")}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        Add Item\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { arrayUtils } from \"@slyte/component\";\nstatic actions() {\n  return{\n      addItem: function() {\n          arrayUtils( this.getData( 'items' ), 'push', data );\n      }\n  }\n}\n```\nFoot Notes\n\nIf you want to open one of the accordion items through script after it is rendered, just query select the accordion item and invoke the click function on it. Doing this does execute the callbacks of the accordion.Utils can be used to achieve this.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-accordion-item' ).click();\n```\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-accordion-item' ).open(); // Open the particular item\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-accordion-item' ).close(); // Close the particular item\n```\n\nMake sure the lyte-accordion and its items are not hidden when the accordion is rendered. The lyte-accordion tries to calculate the heights of its elements so hidden elements don't yield a result. If your accordion is hidden, then set the lt-prop-dynamic property to true so that it can calculate heights on opening.\n\nWhen the accordion renders, it tries to calculate the height of each individual item so that it can use it later. So make sure that the accordion has a layout and has all the required styles loaded when it is about to be rendered. If you want the accordion to calculate on open then set the lt-prop-dynamic property to true.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

It supports both yield and non yield.\n\nDependencies\n```javascript\n<!-- Individual component files -->\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href= \"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-dropdown.css\"></link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-input.css\"></link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-autocomplete.css\"></link>\n\nalso requires a sprite file - node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/images/lyte_ui_sprite.svg - loaded automatically from CSS.\n\n The js file is included in app.js\n```\n```javascript\n<!-- individual components -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/dummy-app-init-for-non-lyte-app.js\" ></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/components/javascript/lyte-dropdown.js\" ></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/components/javascript/lyte-autocomplete.js\" ></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/components/javascript/lyte-input.js\" ></script>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ui-components/theme/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-dropdown.css\"> </link>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ui-components/theme/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-autocomplete.css\"> </link>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ui-components/theme/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-input.css\"> </link>\n\n\nalso requires a sprite file - node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/images/lyte_ui_sprite.svg - loaded automatically from CSS.\n```\nAnatomy\n\nThe anatomy of an autocomplete is shown below.\n\nSimple structure\n\nLet us see the structure of lyte-autocomplete\n\nTags Used\n\nUse the following tags to get a simple structure of an autocomplete\n\nlyte-drop-box - container which is to be positioned\nlyte-drop-body - Renders the dropdown body that shows the filtered suggestions.\nlyte-drop-item - each list item\nlyte-autocomplete-label - main display value\nlyte-autocomplete-description - The The main wrapper tag for the autocomplete component.\nSemantic structure\n```javascript\n<lyte-autocomplete >\n\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\n```javascript\n<lyte-autocomplete lt-prop-yield=\"true\">\n   <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"rateIcon\" >\n    <lyte-drop-box>\n      <lyte-drop-body>\n          <template lyte-for={{someArray}} as item index>\n             <lyte-drop-item data-value = {{index}}>\n                 <lyte-autocomplete-label keywords={{item.keywords}}>\n                     {{item.name}}\n                 </lyte-autocomplete-label>\n                 <lyte-autocomplete-description>\n                    {{item.short}}\n                 </lyte-autocomplete-description>\n             </lyte-drop-item>\n           </template>\n       <lyte-drop-box>\n     <lyte-drop-body>\n  </template>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\nAutocomplete syntax - with and without yield\n```javascript\n<lyte-autocomplete lt-prop-highlight = true lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-label = 'name' lt-prop-description = 'key' >\n\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\n```javascript\n<lyte-autocomplete lt-prop-yield=\"true\">\n   <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"rateIcon\" >\n    <lyte-drop-box>\n      <lyte-drop-body>\n          <template lyte-for={{someArray}} as item index>\n             <lyte-drop-item data-value = {{index}}>\n                 <lyte-autocomplete-label keywords={{item.keywords}}>\n                     {{item.name}}\n                 </lyte-autocomplete-label>\n                 <lyte-autocomplete-description>\n                    {{item.short}}\n                 </lyte-autocomplete-description>\n             </lyte-drop-item>\n           </template>\n       <lyte-drop-box>\n     <lyte-drop-body>\n  </template>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\nDefault Autocomplete\n\nAutocomplete can also be rendered using Array of strings . Here each string will be the display value and the key value for search. You can also customize your own autocomplete with yield.\n\n```html\n<lyte-autocomplete lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-highlight = true on-search = {{method('error')}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n            <template lyte-for=\"{{someArray}} as item index\">\n                    <lyte-drop-item data-value = {{index}}>\n                        <lyte-autocomplete-label>\n                            {{item}}\n                        </lyte-autocomplete-label>\n                    </lyte-drop-item>\n               </template>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-autocomplete lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-highlight = true on-search = {{method('error')}}>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\n// in your component\n\ndata (){\n  return{\n      someArray : prop ( 'array', { default : [\n          \"New file\" , \"open file\" , \"close file\"\n         ]\n     } )\n  }\n}\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    error : function ( visibleList , errorDiv , autocompleElem , inputValue , inputEvent ) {\n        if ( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n            errorDiv.innerText = \"Some error message\"\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-autocomplete>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\nFeatures\nAutocomplete with array of objects\n\nAutocomplete can be rendered by using Array of objects with the ltpropcontent. Your main display value will be ltPropLabel key and ltPropDescription key will be your additional display value. Text search will be based on ltPropLabel value. If ltPropKeywords option is provided search will be based on provided key words. It should be in a array of strings format\n\n```html\n<lyte-autocomplete lt-prop-placeholder = 'Enter something' lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-highlight = true on-search = {{method('error')}}>\n     <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n         <lyte-drop-box>\n             <lyte-drop-body>\n             <template lyte-for={{someArray}}as item index \">\n                     <lyte-drop-item data-value = {{index}}>\n                         <lyte-autocomplete-label keywords={{item.keywords}}>\n                             {{item.name}}\n                         </lyte-autocomplete-label>\n                         <lyte-autocomplete-description>\n                             {{item.short}}\n                         </lyte-autocomplete-description>\n                     </lyte-drop-item>\n                   </template>\n             </lyte-drop-body>\n         </lyte-drop-box>\n     </template>\n </lyte-autocomplete>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-autocomplete lt-prop-highlight = true lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-label = 'name' lt-prop-description = 'key' on-search = {{method('error')}}>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\n// in your component\ndata() {\n  return {\n      someArray : prop ( 'array' , { default : [\n          {\n              \"name\" : \"File\",\n              \"short\" : \"Ctrl+N\",\n              \"keywords\" : [ \"create\" , \"file\" , \"new\" ]\n          },\n          {\n              \"name\" : \"Save\",\n              \"short\" : \"Ctrl+S\",\n              \"keywords\" : [ \"save\", \"file\" ]\n          },\n          {\n              \"name\" : \"Save as\",\n              \"short\" : \"Ctrl+Shift+S\",\n              \"keywords\" : [ \"Save\" , \"save as\" , \"file\" ]\n          }\n        ]\n      }),\n      ltPropLabel : prop ( 'string' , { default : 'name' } ),\n      ltPropDescription : prop ( 'string' , { default : 'short' } ),\n      ltPropKeyWords : prop ( 'string' , { default : 'keywords' } )\n  }\n}\nstatic methods(){\n  return{\n    error : function ( visibleList , errorDiv , autocompleElem , inputValue , inputEvent ) {\n        if ( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n            errorDiv.innerText = \"Some error message\"\n    }\n  }\n}}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-autocomplete>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\nAutocomplete with Grouping\n\nAutocomplete list items can be grouped. Each Object in the given array will be the data for each group to be listed.\n\n```html\n<lyte-autocomplete lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-highlight = true on-search = {{method('error')}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n            <template lyte-for='{{someArray}} as item index'>\n                <lyte-drop-group>\n                <template lyte-for-in=\"{{item}} as value key\">\n                      <lyte-drop-label>{{key}}</lyte-drop-label>\n                      <template lyte-for=\"{{value}} as item index\">\n                            <lyte-drop-item>\n                                <lyte-autocomplete-label>\n                                    {{item.book}}\n                                </lyte-autocomplete-label>\n                                <lyte-autocomplete-description>\n                                    {{item.short}}\n                                </lyte-autocomplete-description>\n                            </lyte-drop-item>\n                        </template>\n                    </template>\n                  </lyte-drop-group>\n                </template>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-autocomplete lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-highlight = true on-search = {{method('error')}} lt-prop-label = \"name\" lt-prop-description = 'author'>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\n// in your component\n\n\ndata(){\n  return {\n      someArray : prop ( 'array' , { default : [\n                {\n                 \"History\" : [\n                      {\n                          \"book\" : \"Ponniyin selvan\" , \"short\" : \"kalki\" , \"keywords\" : [ \"history\", \"kalki\" , \"Ponniyin selvan\" ]\n                      },\n                      {\n                          \"book\" : \"Kadal pura\" , \"short\" : \"Sandilyan\" , \"keywords\" : [ \"sandilyan\" , \"history\" ]\n                      },\n                      {\n                          \"book\" : \"Veera pandian manaivi\" , \"short\" : \"Ramanathan\" , \"keywords\" : [ \"History\" , \"ramanathan\" , \"pandian\" ]\n                      }\n                  ]\n              },\n              {\n                  \"Social\" : [\n                      {\n                          \"book\" : \"Ponniyin selvan\" , \"short\" : \"kalki\" , \"keywords\" : [ \"history\", \"kalki\" , \"Ponniyin selvan\" ]\n                      },\n                      {\n                          \"book\" : \"Kadal pura\" , \"short\" : \"Sandilyan\" , \"keywords\" : [ \"sandilyan\" , \"history\" ]\n                      },\n                      {\n                          \"book\" : \"Veera pandian manaivi\" , \"short\" : \"Ramanathan\" , \"keywords\" : [ \"History\" , \"ramanathan\" , \"pandian\" ]\n                      }\n                  ]\n              }\n            ]\n          })\n  }\n}\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    error : function ( visibleList , errorDiv , autocompleElem , inputValue , inputEvent ) {\n        if( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n            errorDiv.innerText = \"Some error message\"\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-autocomplete>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-group>\n                    <lyte-drop-label></lyte-drop-label>\n                    <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                </lyte-drop-group>\n                <lyte-drop-group>\n                    <lyte-drop-label></lyte-drop-label>\n                    <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item></lyte-drop-item>\n                </lyte-drop-group>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-autocomplete>\n```\nAutocomplete with external search\n\nAutocomplete triggers a callback on keyup( via onExtSearch callback ). You can do some process and set correct data to autocomplete component.

Usually it is used to represent a list of users(in chat rooms or in other social media applications).\n\nIt requires you to pass an array of objects. The lt-prop-url-value represents the key in each object which represents the image url and the lt-prop-system-value represents the key in the object which uniquely identifies the avatar.\n\nImages are rendered in the same order as their order in the array.\n\nThe value of the lt-prop-url-value key in each object is added to the src attribute of an img tag which ends up loading the image. So make sure the url points to the image resource.\n\nThe arrows on the left end and the right end are used to navigate to the previous or next set of images. Images are loaded on demand(only when they slide into view).\n\nWhen the navigator renders, it uses the dimensions of the parent and the width of each image to determine the number of images that can be displayed at once.\n\nThe avatar navigator will try to fill the width of its parent container. It also requires the width of each image in the navigator to be the same. Unequal image widths will break the UI.\n\nThe avatar navigator will try to read the width of each image. Conversely, you can also pass in the image width with lt-prop-image-width property to prevent it from reading it from the DOM(for performance). But the avatar navigator makes no effort in setting width of the image. The lt-prop-image-width is simply an optimization.\n\nYielded Example\n```HTML\n<lyte-avatar-navigator lt-prop-avatar-yield=\"true\" lt-prop-images={{images}} lt-prop-url-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"avatarYield\">\n        <lyte-avatar-navigator-item lt-prop-image={{lyteImage}}></lyte-avatar-navigator-item>\n    </template>\n</lyte-avatar-navigator>\n```\n```javascript\nimages: [ {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/1.jpg',\n    'value': '1'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/2.jpg',\n    'value': '2'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/3.jpg',\n    'value': '3'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/4.jpg',\n    'value': '4'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/5.jpg',\n    'value': '5'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/6.jpg',\n    'value': '6'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/7.jpg',\n    'value': '7'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/8.jpg',\n    'value': '8'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/9.jpg',\n    'value': '9'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/10.jpg',\n    'value': '10'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/11.jpg',\n    'value': '11'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/12.jpg',\n    'value': '12'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/13.jpg',\n    'value': '13'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/14.jpg',\n    'value': '14'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/15.jpg',\n    'value': '15'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/16.jpg',\n    'value': '16'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/17.jpg',\n    'value': '17'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/18.jpg',\n    'value': '18'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/19.jpg',\n    'value': '19'\n}, {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/20.jpg',\n    'value': '20'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/21.jpg',\n    'value': '21'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/22.jpg',\n    'value': '22'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/23.jpg',\n    'value': '23'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/24.jpg',\n    'value': '24'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/25.jpg',\n    'value': '25'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/26.jpg',\n    'value': '26'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/27.jpg',\n    'value': '27'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/28.jpg',\n    'value': '28'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/29.jpg',\n    'value': '29'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/30.jpg',\n    'value': '30'\n} ]\n```\n\nYou can pass in yielded content by setting the lt-prop-avatar-yield to true. The yield is invoked for each image in the navigator.\n\nThe lyte-avatar-navigator-item tag here represents each individual image in the avatar navigator and needs to be used in the avatarYield\n\nThe lt-prop-image={{lyteImage}} is required and must be given when using the yielded avatar navigator. The {{lyteImage}} is an object passed from inside the lyte-avatar-navigator. This object must be passed to lt-prop-image attribute of the lyte-avatar-navigator-item.\n\nSelecting Values\n```HTML\n<lyte-avatar-navigator lt-prop-selected={{selectedObj}} lt-prop-images={{images}} lt-prop-url-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\">\n\n</lyte-avatar-navigator>\n```\n```javascript\nselectedObj: {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/13.jpg',\n    'value': '13'\n}\nimages: [ {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/1.jpg',\n    'value': '1'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/2.jpg',\n    'value': '2'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/3.jpg',\n    'value': '3'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/4.jpg',\n    'value': '4'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/5.jpg',\n    'value': '5'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/6.jpg',\n    'value': '6'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/7.jpg',\n    'value': '7'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/8.jpg',\n    'value': '8'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/9.jpg',\n    'value': '9'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/10.jpg',\n    'value': '10'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/11.jpg',\n    'value': '11'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/12.jpg',\n    'value': '12'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/13.jpg',\n    'value': '13'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/14.jpg',\n    'value': '14'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/15.jpg',\n    'value': '15'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/16.jpg',\n    'value': '16'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/17.jpg',\n    'value': '17'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/18.jpg',\n    'value': '18'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/19.jpg',\n    'value': '19'\n}, {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/20.jpg',\n    'value': '20'\n},\n {\n    'name': '/images/avatar/21.jpg',\n    'value': '21'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/22.jpg',\n    'value': '22'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/23.jpg',\n    'value': '23'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/24.jpg',\n    'value': '24'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/25.jpg',\n    'value': '25'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/26.jpg',\n    'value': '26'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/27.jpg',\n    'value': '27'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/28.jpg',\n    'value': '28'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/29.jpg',\n    'value': '29'\n},\n{\n    'name': '/images/avatar/30.jpg',\n    'value': '30'\n} ]\n```\n\nYou can set the lt-prop-selected attribute of the avatar navigator to select a particular image. Similarly, to get the current selected item, you can use the lt-prop-selected attribute(.ltProp( 'selected' )). Setting lt-prop-selected will position that particular item in the middle.\n\nPreventing Cyclic Navigation\n```HTML\n<lyte-avatar-navigator lt-prop-cyclic=\"false\" lt-prop-images={{images}}

Each breadcrumb items are separated by an Arrow. You can customize it by adding lt-prop-class to lyte-breadcrumb element. It will render both array of strings and array of objects\n\n```html\n<lyte-breadcrumb lt-prop-yield = true on-click = {{method('someMethod')}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-breadcrumb-structure>\n            <%someArray.forEach( function( item, index ){%>\n                <lyte-breadcrumb-item data-value = {{item.order}}>\n                    <lyte-breadcrumb-body>\n                        {{item.name}}\n                    </lyte-breadcrumb-body>\n                </lyte-breadcrumb-item>\n            <%})%>\n        </lyte-breadcrumb-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-breadcrumb>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-breadcrumb lt-prop-label = 'name' lt-prop-data = {{someArray}} on-click = {{method('someMethod')}}>\n</lyte-breadcrumb>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component Js file\ndata(){\n  return {\n      someArray : prop ( 'array' , { default : [\n          { \"name\" : \"home\" , \"order\" : 1 } ,\n          { \"name\" : \"new\" , \"order\" : 2 } ,\n          { \"name\" : \"edit\" , \"order\" : 3 } ,\n          { \"name\" : \"save\" , \"order\" : 4 } ]\n      } )\n  }\n}\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    someMethod : function ( clickedItem , breadcrumb , event , data ) {\n        // your operations\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-breadcrumb>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-breadcrumb-structure>\n            <lyte-breadcrumb-item>\n                <lyte-breadcrumb-body></lyte-breadcrumb-body>\n            </lyte-breadcrumb-item>\n            <lyte-breadcrumb-item>\n                <lyte-breadcrumb-body></lyte-breadcrumb-body>\n            </lyte-breadcrumb-item>\n            <lyte-breadcrumb-item>\n                <lyte-breadcrumb-body></lyte-breadcrumb-body>\n            </lyte-breadcrumb-item>\n        </lyte-breadcrumb-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-breadcrumb>\n```\nAdvanced breadcrumb\n\nThe lyte-breadcrumb component supports an advanced responsive type, which automatically adjusts to the available width. When the number of breadcrumb items exceeds the visible space, the extra items gets collapsed into a dropdown menu, keeping the breadcrumb clean and user-friendly across all screen sizes.\n\nIt supports only the yield type for customization.\n\n```html\n<lyte-breadcrumb lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-type = \"advanced\" lt-prop-data = {{someArray}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <template if=\"{{ltPropDropdown}}\">\n            <lyte-breadcrumb-item data-value =\n            {{ltPropContent.order}} >\n                <lyte-breadcrumb-body>\n                    {{ltPropContent.name}}\n                </lyte-breadcrumb-body>\n            </lyte-breadcrumb-item>\n        </template>\n        <template lyte-else>\n            <%ltPropContent.forEach( function( item, index ){%>\n                <lyte-breadcrumb-item data-value =  {{item.order}}>\n                    <lyte-breadcrumb-body>\n                        <a> {{item.name}}</a>\n                    </lyte-breadcrumb-body>\n                </lyte-breadcrumb-item>\n            <%})%>\n        </template>\n    </template>\n</lyte-breadcrumb>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { prop } from \"@slyte/core\";\n // in your component\n data() {\n   return {\n       someArray : prop( 'array' , { default : [\n       { \"name\" : \"one\" , \"order\" : 1 } ,\n       { \"name\" : \"two\" , \"order\" : 2 } ,\n       { \"name\" : \"three\" , \"order\" : 3 } ,\n       { \"name\" : \"four\" , \"order\" : 4 } ,\n       { \"name\" : \"five\" , \"order\" : 5 } ,\n       { \"name\" : \"six\" , \"order\" : 6 } ,\n       { \"name\" : \"seven\" , \"order\" : 7 } ,\n       { \"name\" : \"eight\" , \"order\" : 8 },\n       { \"name\" : \"nine\" , \"order\" : 9 } ,\n       { \"name\" : \"ten\" , \"order\" : 10 } ,\n       { \"name\" : \"eleven\" , \"order\" : 11 }\n     ]\n     } ),\n   }}\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

It can be any valid color value - named/rgb/hsl/hex/global. Lyte-button attempts to set the style attribute with the background property and the border property. It should be noted that the lt-prop-style takes higher precedence over the lt-prop-background-color property. So a background-color set through lt-prop-style will be the final style of the button.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button lt-prop-background-color=\"#42A5F5\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        Blue\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\nBlue Cyan Teal Amber Orange Brown Grey Black\nOutlined Buttons\n\nA button can also take in a lt-prop-color attribute.

This component is fully customizeable. It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators\n\nBy default, lt-prop-auto-play is set false. Setting to true will play the automatic cycling through slides.\n\n```html\n<lyte-carousel lt-prop-active-index=\"0\" lt-prop-data={{yourData}} lt-prop-records=\"2\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"carouselBoxYield\">\n        <lyte-carousel-prev> </lyte-carousel-prev>\n        <lyte-carousel-content>\n            <lyte-carousel-item> Content 1 </lyte-carousel-item>\n            <lyte-carousel-item> Content 2 </lyte-carousel-item>\n        </lyte-carousel-content>\n        <lyte-carousel-indicator>\n            <lyte-carousel-indicator-item data-value=\"0\"> 1 </lyte-carousel-indicator-item>\n            <lyte-carousel-indicator-item data-value=\"1\"> 2 </lyte-carousel-indicator-item>\n        </lyte-carousel-indicator>\n        <lyte-carousel-next> </lyte-carousel-next>\n    </template>\n</lyte-carousel>\n```\n Vertical Orientation\n\nSet your predefined data for carousel using lt-prop-data. You can also provide the total number of slides using lt-prop-records. The current active slide or the slide which should be displayed is set using lt-prop-active-index.\n\nCarousel With Fade\n\nYou can render a carousel with fade animation. For this you need to set ltPropEffect attribute to fade . You can also add the indicators to the carousel along with previous and next icon.\n\n```html\n<lyte-carousel lt-prop-active-index=\"0\" lt-prop-data={{yourData}} lt-prop-effect=\"fade\" lt-prop-records=\"2\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"carouselBoxYield\">\n        <lyte-carousel-prev> </lyte-carousel-prev>\n        <lyte-carousel-content>\n            <lyte-carousel-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_1.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-item>\n            <lyte-carousel-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_2.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-item>\n        </lyte-carousel-content>\n        <lyte-carousel-indicator>\n            <lyte-indicator-item data-value=\"0\"> 1 </lyte-indicator-item>\n            <lyte-indicator-item data-value=\"1\"> 2 </lyte-indicator-item>\n        </lyte-carousel-indicator>\n        <lyte-carousel-next> </lyte-carousel-next>\n    </template>\n</lyte-carousel>\n```\n Vertical Orientation\nCarousel With Sub Item\n\nYou can render a carousel with more than a single image in each slide. For this you need to use lyte-carousel-sub-itemtag inside lyte-carousel-item tag.\n\n```html\n<lyte-carousel lt-prop-active-index=\"0\" lt-prop-data={{yourData}} lt-prop-effect=\"fade\" lt-prop-records=\"2\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"carouselBoxYield\">\n        <lyte-carousel-prev> </lyte-carousel-prev>\n        <lyte-carousel-content>\n            <lyte-carousel-item>\n                <lyte-carousel-sub-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_1.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-sub-item>\n                <lyte-carousel-sub-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_2.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-sub-item>\n            </lyte-carousel-item>\n            <lyte-carousel-item>\n                <lyte-carousel-sub-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_3.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-sub-item>\n                <lyte-carousel-sub-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_4.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-sub-item>\n            </lyte-carousel-item>\n        </lyte-carousel-content>\n        <lyte-carousel-indicator>\n            <lyte-indicator-item data-value=\"0\"> 1 </lyte-indicator-item>\n            <lyte-indicator-item data-value=\"1\"> 2 </lyte-indicator-item>\n        </lyte-carousel-indicator>\n        <lyte-carousel-next> </lyte-carousel-next>\n    </template>\n</lyte-carousel>\n```\n Vertical Orientation\nSub Item With Frames\n\nYou can render a carousel image using frames by adding lyteCarouselFrames class.\n\n```html\n<lyte-carousel lt-prop-active-index=\"0\" lt-prop-data={{yourData}} lt-prop-effect=\"fade\" lt-prop-records=\"2\" class=\"lyteCarouselFrames\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"carouselBoxYield\">\n        <lyte-carousel-prev> </lyte-carousel-prev>\n        <lyte-carousel-content>\n            <lyte-carousel-item>\n                <lyte-carousel-sub-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_1.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-sub-item>\n                <lyte-carousel-sub-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_2.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-sub-item>\n            </lyte-carousel-item>\n            <lyte-carousel-item>\n                <lyte-carousel-sub-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_3.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-sub-item>\n                <lyte-carousel-sub-item> <img src=\"/images/carousel_pic/landscape_4.jpeg\"> </lyte-carousel-sub-item>\n            </lyte-carousel-item>\n        </lyte-carousel-content>\n        <lyte-carousel-indicator>\n            <lyte-indicator-item data-value=\"0\"> 1 </lyte-indicator-item>\n            <lyte-indicator-item data-value=\"1\"> 2 </lyte-indicator-item>\n        </lyte-carousel-indicator>\n        <lyte-carousel-next> </lyte-carousel-next>\n    </template>\n</lyte-carousel>\n```\n Vertical Orientation\nCarousel With Custom Slides\n\nApart from the image, you can render any html, text, etc just like the below example. The given will get rendered in the form of slides.\n\n Vertical Orientation\nMorbi tincidunt, dui sit amet facilisis feugiat, odio metus gravida ante, ut pharetra massa metus id nunc.

For this you need to use the $L.snippets.registerLanguage global util to register your own language.\n\nHere is an example of how the code snippet plugin implements CSS with $L.snippets.registerLanguage util\n\nCopy\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n(function (){$L.snippets.registerLanguage ('css', {tokenConfig: [{'token': 'comment',\n'class': 'lyteCSSComment',\n'regex': /\\/ * ([sS ] *? ) *\\\n//\n}, {'group': 'ruleset',\n'regex': /.+?(?={){[sS]*?(?=})}/, 'matched-elements': [{'group': 'selector',\n'regex': /.+?(?={)/, 'matched-elements': [{'token': 'combinator',\n'class': 'lyteCSSCombinator',\n'regex': /[+>~]/\n                        }, {'group': 'attribute-selector',\n'regex': /[.+?(?=])]/, 'matched-elements': [{'token': 'punctuation',\n'class': 'lyteCSSPunctuation',\n'regex': /[[]]/\n                                }, {'token': 'attribute-name',\n'class': 'lyteCSSAttributeName',\n'regex': /[^[]=]+?(?==)/\n                                }, {'group': 'attribute-value',\n'regex': /=.*?(?=])]/, 'matched-elements': [{'token': 'punctuation',\n'class': 'lyteCSSPunctuation',\n'regex': /[=]]/\n                                        }, {'token': 'attribute-value',\n'regex': /[^=]*?(?=])/, 'class': 'lyteCSSAttributeValue'}]}]}, {'token': 'selector',\n'class': 'lyteCSSSelector',\n'regex': /[^+>~[]*/\n                        }]}, {'group': 'rulebody',\n'regex': /{[sS]*?(?=})}/, 'matched-elements': [{'class': 'lyteCSSPunctuation',\n'token': 'punctuation',\n'regex': /[{}]/\n                        }, {'group': 'declaration',\n'regex': /[^{}]+?(?=[;}]);?/, 'matched-elements': [{'token': 'rule-name',\n'regex': /[S]+?(?=:)/, 'class': 'lyteCSSRuleName'}, {'group': 'rule-value',\n'regex': /:[sS]+?(?=[;}]);?/, 'matched-elements': [{'group': 'rule-value',\n'regex': /[^:;][^;}]*/, 'matched-elements': [{'token': 'color-value',\n'regex': /s*#.*/, 'class': 'lyteCSSColorValue'}, {'token': 'rule-value',\n'regex': 'remaining',\n'class': 'lyteCSSRuleValue'}]}, {'token': 'punctuation',\n'regex': /[:;]/, 'class': 'lyteCSSPunctuation'}]}]}]}]}]});\n})();\n\nHere the $L.snippets.registerLanguage will take in a tokenConfig key which will contain the information about the tokens in the language.\n\nA language can be broken down into a stream of tokens and each token can be represented by a regular expression. In our example, the first token is the comment token which is represented by the corresponding regular expression. The class attribute corresponds to the class to be added to the matched string when rendering the element. By adding color css properties to this class, you can highlight the token.\n\nAnother concept available in the code-snippet plugin is the concept of groups. Groups can be broken further down into groups or tokens. Groups makes it easier to reason about the structure of the language. In our example, the ruleset group which represents a particular CSS rule, is broken down into the selector group and the rulebody group which are further broken down into other groups and tokens. The broken down groups and tokens are represented through the matched-elements key. The file bottom most elements in this hierarchy are tokens which are again represented by a regular expression.\n\nWorkings Of The Tokenizing Engine\n\nWhen an input string is fed into the component along with the language, the tokenizing engine starts walking through the text and applies each of the regular expressions in the tokenConfig.\n\nWhen matching the text, it will try to select the best token(regular expression) from the list of available tokens in tokenConfig. The best token to select is based on maximal munch rule where the longest matched string best represents the proper syntax or the rule to select (For eg, lets say the string passed is ifvar and lets say there are two rules, one for if and another for identifiers(string of characters). The second rule is matched because it is the longest match even though the first rule also matches). Once the token is matched, the class for the token is applied after creating an element for it.\n\nTokens are always matched from the start of the string. If the start of the string does not match any token in the tokenConfig, then it called an unmatched token. The unmatched token has a lyteCSUnmatchedToken class added to it. After matching an unmatched token, the next index from which a token matches is used to continue the tokenizing phase. white spaces that are matched have a lyteCSWhiteSpace class added to them. Once the entire string is consumed, the classes are added to the tokens by creating a span tag and putting the token's string as the span's textContent and this constructed document fragment is displayed as the result.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "File upload\n\nFileupload is used to upload files to the server. The file uploader UI component, uses the input type file for selecting files. You can also drag and paste files for uploading.\n```html\n<!-- Individual component css files -->\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-fileupload.css\"></link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-text.css\"></link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-tooltip.css\"></link>\n\nalso requires a sprite file - node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/images/lyte_ui_sprite.svg - loaded automatically from CSS.\n```\n\nAnatomy\n\nThe anatomy of a fileuploader is as shown below.\n\nThe tags of the lyte-fileupload are as follows\n\nlyte-file-select-area -On clicking the lyte-file-select-area, select window will open.\nlyte-file-message - Placeholder for lyte-fileupload.\nfileBucket - List of currently selected files.\nlyte-file-close - file will be removed from fileBucket.\nlyte-file-retry - failed files will be uploaded again.\nDefault Fileuploader\n\nA simple example for lyte-fileupload is given below. You can also customize lyte-fileupload by using yield. The single fileupload will hide the file select area, once the file is selected from file window. So we have provided multiple and single fileupload as differnet snippets for yielded syntax.\n\nNote : lt-prop-multiple as true allows you to choose multiple files. lt-prop-ajax is used to make a XMLHttpRequest to the server and it is an object, which is similar to $L.ajax first argument.

FormData is a web API, click here to know more. In the FormData, you can append the field values along with the selected files which you can get as an array using lt-prop-files API. Then you can create an XMLHttpRequest to send the FormData. An example is shown below.\n\n```html\n<form-comp>\n<form onsubmit=\"{{action('returningFalse')}}\">\nName :\n<lyte-input lt-prop-id=\"name\" lt-prop-placeholder=\"Enter your name\"\nlt-prop-name=\"name\" lt-prop-value=\"lbind(formFields.name)\">\n</lyte-input>\nId :\n<lyte-input lt-prop-id=\"id\" lt-prop-name=\"id\" lt-prop-placeholder=\"Enter your id\"\nlt-prop-value=\"lbind(formFields.id)\">\n</lyte-input>\n<lyte-fileupload lt-prop-appearance=\"Btn\" lt-prop-multiple=true lt-prop-files=\"{{lbind(Files)}}\"\nlt-prop-auto-upload=false>\n</lyte-fileupload>\n<lyte-button onclick={{action('click')}} lt-prop-type=\"submit\">\n<template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\nSubmit\n</template>\n</lyte-button>\n</form>\n</form-comp>\n```\n```javascript\nclass FormComp extends Component {\ndata(){\nreturn {\nformFields : prop('object', {\"default\" : {\nname : '',\nid : ''\n}}),\nfiles : prop('array', { \"default\" : []})\n}\n},\nstatic actions() {\nreturn {\nreturningFalse:function(){\nevent.preventDefault();\n},\nclick1:function(){\n/* retrieve the files and formFields */\nvar files = this.getData(\"files\");\nvar formFields = this.getData(\"formFields\");\nvar formdata = new FormData();\nfor(const key in formFields) {\nformdata.append(key,formFields[key]);\n}\nfor(var i=0;i < files.length;i++){\nformdata.append(\"file\"+i,files[i]);\n}\n$L.ajax({\nprocessData: false,\ncontentType: false,\nurl:'/Fileupload',\ntype:'POST',\ndata:formdata,\nsuccess:function(){\nconsole.log( 'succeeded' );\n}\n});\n}\n}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    }\n}\n```\n\nExample :\n\nPredefined Files\n\nIf some files are already uploaded in the server and if you want to display those files in the client side, then you can use predefinedList as follow.\n\n```html\n<lyte-fileupload  predefined-list={{sampleData}} lt-prop-ajax='{\"url\":\"/Fileupload\"}'>\n</lyte-fileupload>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-fileupload lt-prop-yield=true  predefined-list={{sampleData}}\nlt-prop-ajax='{\"url\" : \"/Fileupload\"}' >\n<template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"file\">\n<lyte-file-select-area>\n<lyte-file-message class=\"lyteFileUpdMsgWrap\">\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdMsg\">\n<!-- placeholder for lyte-fileupload -->\nDrag file here or browse to upload\n</span>\n</lyte-file-message>\n</lyte-file-select-area>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdList\">\n<template lyte-for=\"{{predefinedList}} as item index\">\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdListFile\">\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdTypePreview\">\n<template lyte-if='{{item.src}}'>\n<!-- Thumbnail image -->\n<img class=\"lyteFileUpdThumb\" src={{item.src}}>\n</template>\n<template lyte-else>\n<!-- file icon -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdTypeIcon {{item.fileType}}\">\n</span>\n</template>\n</div>\n<!-- file name -->\n<lyte-text class=\"lyteFileUpdFileName\" lt-prop-value={{item.name}}>\n</lyte-text>\n<!-- file size -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdFileSize\">\n({{lyteUiFileSize(item.size, 'KB', 2)}})\n</span>\n<!-- close icon -->\n<lyte-file-close data-value={{item.id}}>\n</lyte-file-close>\n< /div >\n</template>\n<!-- queueList contains a list of currently selected files -->\n<template lyte-for=\"{{queueList}} as item index\">\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdListFile {{concat('lyteFile',lyteUiCapitalizeName(item.status))}}\">\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdTypePreview\">\n<template lyte-if=\"{{item.src}}\">\n<!-- Thumbnail image -->\n<img class=\"lyteFileUpdThumb\" src={{item.src}} >\n</template>\n<template lyte-else>\n<!-- file icon -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdTypeIcon {{item.fileType}}\"></span>\n</template>\n</div>\n<!-- file name -->\n<lyte-text class=\"lyteFileUpdFileName\" lt-prop-value={{item.name}}>\n</lyte-text>\n<!-- file size -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdFileSize\">\n({{lyteUiFileSize(item.size, 'KB', 2)}})\n</span>\n<template lyte-if='{{item.percentage}}'>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdFileStatus\" data-completed={{item.percentage}}>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdProgressBar\"gt;\n<!-- file progress bar -->\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdProgressFill\"\nstyle=\"width:{{item.percentage}}%\">\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</template>\n<template lyte-if=\"{{item.status=='error'}}\">\n<lyte-file-retry data-value={{item.id}}>\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdFailMsg\">\nFailed<!-- failure message -->\n</span>\n<template lyte-if='{{!ltPropUploadMultiple}}'>\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdRetryMsg\">\nRetry<!-- retry message -->\n</span>\n</template>\n</lyte-file-retry>\n</template>\n<template lyte-if=\"{{ !ltPropUploadMultiple || item.status !== 'uploading'}}\">\n<!-- close icon -->\n<lyte-file-close data-value = {{item.id}} class = {{item.status}}>\n</lyte-file-close>\n</template>\n</div>\n</template>\n</div>\n</template>\n</lyte-fileupload>\n```\n```javascript\ndata() {\nreturn{\nsampleData: prop(\"array\",{default:[\n{name:\"sample.png\",size:23000,id:1},\n{name:\"sample.doc\",size:2100,id:2}\n]})\n}\n}\n```\n\nExample :\nChunk uploader with server\nClient Side:\n\nThe default file uploader won't process files in which the fileSize exceeds the lt-prop-file-limit.

By default, the value of ltPropRetry or ltPropChunkRetry is 2. While retrying on-retry method will be triggered. After the completion of on-retry method, success or failure method will be called. You can also resend the file, by clicking the retry button.\n\nNote : While clicking the retry button, on-retry method won't be fired.\n\n```html\n<lyte-fileupload lt-prop-retry=1 lt-prop-ajax = '{\"url\" : \"/Fileupload\"}'>\n</lyte-fileupload>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-fileupload lt-prop-yield=true lt-prop-retry=1\nlt-prop-ajax='{\"url\" : \"/Fileupload\"}'>\n<template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"file\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t            <lyte-file-select-area>\n<lyte-file-message class=\"lyteFileUpdMsgWrap\">\n<!-- placeholder for lyte-fileupload -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdMsg\">Drag file here or browse to upload </span>\n</lyte-file-message>\n</lyte-file-select-area>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdList\">\n<!-- queueList contains a list of currently selected files -->\n<%queueList.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdListFile {{item.status}}\">\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdTypePreview\">\n<%if(item.src){%>\n<!-- Thumbnail image -->\n<img class=\"lyteFileUpdThumb\" src={{item.src}} >\n<%}else{%>\n<!-- file icon -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdTypeIcon {{item.fileType}}\"></span>\n<%}%>\n</div>\n<!-- file name -->\n<lyte-text class=\"lyteFileUpdFileName\" lt-prop-value={{item.name}}>\n</lyte-text>\n<!-- file size -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdFileSize\">\n({{lyteUiFileSize(item.size, 'KB', 2)}})\n</span>\n<%if(!ltPropUploadMultiple){%>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdFileStatus\" data-completed={{item.percentage}}>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdProgressBar {{item.status}}\">\n<!-- file progress bar -->\n<divclass=\"lyteFileUpdProgressFill\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        style=\"width:{{item.percentage}}%\">\n\t                                            </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<}%if(item.status==\"error\"){%>\n<lyte-file-retry data-value={{item.id}}>\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdFailMsg\">\n\t\t\t                                    Failed<!-- failure message -->\n</span>\n<%if(!ltPropUploadMultiple){%>\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdRetryMsg\">\nRetry<!-- retry message -->\n</span>\n<%}%>\n</lyte-file-retry>\n<%}%>\n<%if((!ltPropUploadMultiple)||\n(!item.status||item.status==\"error\"||item.status==\"success\")){%>\n<!-- close icon -->\n<lyte-file-close data-value = {{item.id}} class = {{item.status}}>\n</lyte-file-close>\n<%}%>\n</div>\n<%})%>\n</div>\n</template>\n</lyte-fileupload>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-fileupload lt-prop-yield=true lt-prop-chunk-retry=1\nlt-prop-chunk = true lt-prop-chunk-size = 200000 lt-prop-ajax='{\"url\":\"/Fileupload\"}'>\n<template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"file\">\n<lyte-file-select-area>\n<lyte-file-message class=\"lyteFileUpdMsgWrap\">\n<!-- placeholder for lyte-fileupload -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdMsg\">Drag file here or browse to upload </span>\n</lyte-file-message>\n</lyte-file-select-area>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdList\">\n<!-- queueList contains a list of currently selected files -->\n<%queueList.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdListFile {{item.status}}\">\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdTypePreview\">\n<%if(item.src){%>\n<!-- Thumbnail image -->\n<img class=\"lyteFileUpdThumb\" src={{item.src}} >\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    <%}else{%>\n<!-- file icon -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdTypeIcon {{item.fileType}}\"></span>\n<%}%>\n</div>\n<!-- file name -->\n<lyte-text class=\"lyteFileUpdFileName\" lt-prop-value={{item.name}}>\n</lyte-text>\n<!-- file size -->\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdFileSize\">\n({{lyteUiFileSize(item.size, 'KB', 2)}})\n</span>\n<%if(!ltPropUploadMultiple){%>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdFileStatus\" data-completed={{item.percentage}}>\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdProgressBar {{item.status}}\">\n<!-- file progress bar -->\n<div class=\"lyteFileUpdProgressFill\"\nstyle=\"width:{{item.percentage}}%\">\n</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    </div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t        <}%if(item.status==\"error\"){%>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    <lyte-file-retry data-value={{item.id}}>\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdFailMsg\">\n\t                                        Failed<!-- failure message -->\n</span>\n<%if(!ltPropUploadMultiple){%>\n<span class=\"lyteFileUpdRetryMsg\">\nRetry<!-- retry message -->\n\t\t\t\t                            </span>\n<%}%>\n</lyte-file-retry>\n<%}%>\n<%if((!ltPropUploadMultiple)||\n(!item.status||item.status==\"error\"||item.status==\"success\")){%>\n<!-- close icon -->\n<lyte-file-close data-value = {{item.id}} class = {{item.status}}>\n</lyte-file-close>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    <%}%>\n</div>\n<%})%>\n</div>\n</template>\n</lyte-fileupload>\n```\nExample :\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

Here grids are arranged according to the given position and dimensions.\n\nElement matches lt-prop-scope selector will be considered as grid container element. Every elements matching lt-prop-handler selector will be considered as grid elements.\n\n\n\nIndividual grid positions and dimensions are defined in attributes.\n\nlyte-grid-x will take x units in horizontal direction.\n\nlyte-grid-y will take y units in vertical direction.\n\nlyte-grid-length will take given units as length.\n\nlyte-grid-height will take given units as height.\n\nSome properties of gridstack are as follows\n\n\nFloat - By default, grids will be moved upwards if it has enough spaces at top to occupy. If float is enabled grids will be placed at its dropped position. It won't move upwards on drop.\nUndo - This property allows undo and redo handlings.\nHorizontal - It defines grid movement direction. Generally during grid overlap other grids will be adjusted vertically. If this is enabled grids will be repositioned in horizontal direction.\nBestfit - This is to indicate the final position of a moving grid element when it is released at any time. Best fit will not be shown if multiple grids are selected for moving.\nFreezeMode - It will not allow grids to select and drag\nColumnMode - It will create column like grids. You can specify column count. Given grid positions and dimensions are ignored if it is enabled.\n\n Float \n Bestfit \n Undo \n Horizontal \n Freeze mode \n Column mode Create Grid\n\nOn observing the below code snippet, you can find that lt-prop-grid-length is set as 11 . Here the main gridstack container area will be converted to 11 parts in horizontal direction.\n\naddGrid - This util is used to add a new grid to already rendered gridstack element.\n\nsetProperty - This util is used to update length, height, resize, x, y propeties of a individual grid\n\nreRender - This util will refresh entire gridstack. In any case if width of gridstack area is changed or any grid modification you can call this util.\n\nremoveGrid - This will remove a individual grid reference from gridstack\n\n```html\n<lyte-gridstack style = \"height: 400px\" lt-prop-bestfit-type = 'grid' lt-prop-grid-length = 11 lt-prop-scope=\"div.lyteGridStack\" lt-prop-handler=\".lyteGridStackItem\">\n<template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"lyteGridStack\">\n     <div class=\"lyteGridStack\">\n        <div class=\"lyteGridStackItem grid\" lyte-grid-length=3 lyte-grid-height=3 style=\"background: green;color : white;\">\n            <lyte-grid-content>1 </lyte-grid-content>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteGridStackItem grid\" lyte-grid-length=3 lyte-grid-height=3 lyte-grid-resize=\"disabled\">\n            <lyte-grid-content style=\"background: green;color : white;\">2 U can't change my size </lyte-grid-content>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteGridStackItem grid\" lyte-grid-length=3 lyte-grid-height=3 style=\"background: green;color : white;\">\n            <lyte-grid-content>3 </lyte-grid-content>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteGridStackItem grid\" lyte-grid-length=1 lyte-grid-height=2 style=\"background: green;color : white;\">\n            <lyte-grid-content>4 </lyte-grid-content>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteGridStackItem grid\" lyte-grid-length=2 lyte-grid-height=3 style=\"background: green;color : white;\">\n            <lyte-grid-content>5 </lyte-grid-content>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteGridStackItem grid\" lyte-grid-y=0 lyte-grid-length=3 lyte-grid-height=3>\n             <lyte-grid-content style=\"background: green;color : white;\">6 </lyte-grid-content>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteGridStackItem grid\" lyte-grid-length=2 lyte-grid-height=3>\n            <lyte-grid-content style=\"background: green;color : white;\">7 </lyte-grid-content>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteGridStackItem grid\" lyte-grid-length=2 lyte-grid-height=3>\n            <lyte-grid-content style=\"background: green;color : white;\">8 </lyte-grid-content>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteGridStackItem grid\" lyte-grid-length=2 lyte-grid-height=3>\n            <lyte-grid-content style=\"background: green;color : white;\">9 </lyte-grid-content>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</template>\n</lyte-gridstack>\n```\n```javascript\n// for adding a new grid\n\ndocument.querySelector( \"lyte-gridstack\" ).addGrid( newGrid , { x : 0 , y : 0 , length : 2 , height : 2 , minLength : 2 , maxLength : 4 , minHeight : 2 , maxHeight : 4 , resize : 'disabled' } )\n```\n```javascript\n// for changing existing property\n\ndocument.querySelector ( \"lyte-gridstack\" ). setProperty ( targetDiv , 'length' , 3 )\n```\n```javascript\n// for refreshing entire gridstack positions\ndocument.querySelector( \"lyte-gridstack\" ).reRender()\n```\n```javascript\n// for removing existing grids\ndocument.querySelector( \"lyte-gridstack\" ).removeGrid( existingGrid )\n```\nPlaceholder\n\nYou can show a placeholder while dragging an external element ( drag and drop ) or a gridstack grid from another lyte-gridstack element.\n\nCalling a placeholder will create an empty placeholder grid. You can update the placeholder position based on your drag / mousemove event. You can also remove the placeholder. To do so, the dragging element should not receive any pointer events. Refer the below code snippet to see how drag and drop functionalities are handled between two gridstacks.\n\n```html\n<div class=\"example_container pR oAuto\">\n  <style type=\"text/css\">\n

    "content": "Kanban View\nIntroduction\n\nKanban view, a performance based visual UI component, helping to organise the work-items, tasks, products, records etc in swimlines. This component helps to visually manage and organise a process. It also lets to sort the records and define your own stages to ideally map your records.\n\nHow it Works\n\nLet us see the working of Kanban view comoponent.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte/polyfill-bundle.js\"> </script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js\"> </script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte/lyte-es5.js\"> </script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte-dom/lyte-dom.js\"> </script>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ui-components/plugins/lyte-sortable.js\"> </script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ui-components/components/styles/lyte-ui-sortable.css\"> </link>\n\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ui-components/components/lyte-kanban.js\"> </script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ui-components/theme/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-kanban.css\"> </link>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ui-components/components/lyte-card.js\"> </script>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ui-components/theme/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-card.css\"> </link>\n```\nAnatomy  Working in detail\n\nAs shown in the anatomy, a Kanban view has three parts namely lyte-kanbanView, lyte-board, lyte-card.\n\nlyte-kanbanView\n\nlyte-kanbanView is the outermost layer. Here you have to pass the list of all boards and cards using the property ltPropBoardDetails.\n\nlyte-board\n\nltPropBoardDetail is a collection of lyte board items. And each board item is a collection of card items. lyte-board serves as a collection of lyte-cards. To pass the lyte-board, mandatory properties like ltPropBoardDetail, ltPropKanbanId, ltPropIndex is required.\n\nHere ltPropBoardDetail corresponds to lyteBoardItem. ltPropKanbanId corresponds to a dummy Id and ltPropIndex corresponds to the position of the board. All properties are available in 'ltBoardItem', 'ltKanbanId' and 'lyteIndex' variables.\n\nlyte-card\n\nlyte-cards corresponds to the individual card on the board. The variable 'lytecardItem' contains the information about the individual card.\n\nThe ltPropBoardDetails is an array of objects. Each object corresponds to a board. And each board has a list of cards which is also an array of objects. Here ltBoardItem corresponds to the top most item and ltCardItem corresponds to the object inside the lyteBoardItem.\n\nIt is manadatory for lyteBoardItem to have a key named as 'cards'. This cards must be an array of objects containing all cards.\n\nFeatures\n\nHave a look at the standout features of Kanban View.\n\nKanbanView Without Sortable\n\nBy default, you can see that the lyte-card and lyte-board being sortable. You can also set them as unsortable using the property ltPropSortable to '{\"board\":false,\"card\":false}'.\n\n```html\n<lyte-kanbanview lt-prop-board-details = {{details}}  lt-prop-sortable = '{\"board\":false,\"card\":false}'>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"kanbanYield\">\n        <lyte-board lt-prop-board-detail={{lyteBoardItem}} lt-prop-kanban-id={{lyteKanbanId}} lt-prop-index={{lyteIndex}} lt-prop-board-sortable=true >\n            <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"headerItem\">\n            {{boardDetails.id}}\n            </template>\n            <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"contentItem\">\n                <lyte-card >\n                    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n                       <lyte-card-body>\n                        <pre>\n                            Full name {{lyteCardItem.full_name}}\n                        </pre>\n                        </lyte-card-body>\n                    </template>\n\n                </lyte-card>\n            </template>\n            <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"loading\">\n                your loading content\n            </template>\n        </lyte-board>\n    </template>\n</lyte-kanbanview>\n```\nKanbanView With Lazy Loading\n\nIn Kanbanview you can also load the board and cards with lazy loading functionalities using onBodyScroll and onBoardScroll method for kanbanview and board.\n\nNote : To load more records in scroll and to trigger onBoardScroll and onBodyScroll, you need to set ltPropMoreStageRecord as true for kanbanview and board component.\n\n```html\n<lyte-kanbanview lt-prop-board-details = {{details}}  on-body-scroll = {{method('bodyscroll')}} >\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"kanbanYield\">\n        <lyte-board lt-prop-board-detail={{lyteKanbanItem}} lt-prop-kanban-id={{lyteKanbanId}}  lt-prop-index= {{lyteIndex}} on-board-scroll = {{method('boardscroll')}}>\n            <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"headerItem\">\n            {{boardDetails.id}}\n            </template>\n            <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"contentItem\">\n                <lyte-card >\n                    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n                        <lyte-card-body>\n                        <pre>\n                            Full name {{lyteCardItem.full_name}}\n                        </pre>\n                        </lyte-card-body>\n                    </template>\n\n                </lyte-card>\n            </template>\n            <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"loading\">\n                your loading content\n            </template>\n        </lyte-board>\n    </template>\n</lyte-kanbanview>\n```\nViewport enabled KanbanView\n\nYou can enable the viewport setting for the lyte-board and lyte-card with the property ltPropViewPort. You can learn more about viewport here.\n\nExpand and Collapse\n\nUsing the util expand and collapse, you can expand and collapse the lyte-board.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 92,
    "content": "KeyboardNavigator\n\nThe Keyboard Navigator, a UI component, is used to highlight a particular element in a dropdown or menu component or a similar one. Using various keyboard navigation events the highlighted element can be changed.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- lyte files -->\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte/polyfill-bundle.js\"> </script>\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte/custom-elements-es5-adapter.js\"> </script>\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte/lyte-es5.js\"> </script>\n\n <!-- common ui-component files -->\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte-dom/lyte-dom.js\"> </script>\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ui-components/I18n/en_US.js\"> </script>\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ui-components/components/helpers/helpers.js\"> </script>\n\n<!-- Individual component files -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ui-components/components/lyte-keyboard-navigator.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ui-components/plugins/lyte-keyboard-navigator.js\"></script>\n```\nDefault Keyboard Navigator\n\nThe component has to be rendered in a popover/dropdown items which are rendered with an origin element. It is required to prevent the focus from entering into the dropbox / popover-content elements. For eg., by using lt-prop-prevent-focus in popover.\n\nFor implementing the keyboard navigation functionality the following mandatory values are to be provided.\n* Parent - the element upon which the keyboard navigator is called, in other words the element to which the focus has to be given,\n* Scope - the wrapper div / element enclosing the elements to be highlighted,\n* Children - the selector (className) of the elements to be highlighted,\n* Highlighted - the default element to be highlighted when the component is rendered,\n* Selected - the className which is to be added to the selected element.\n\n```html\n<lyte-popover lt-prop-origin-elem = \"#popover\" lt-prop-prevent-focus = \"true\">\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"popover\">\n        <lyte-popover-content>\n            <lyte-keyboard-navigator\n                lt-prop-parent = \"#popover\"\n                lt-prop-scope = \"#scope\"\n                lt-prop-children=\".child\"\n                lt-prop-highlighted=\".highlight\"\n                lt-prop-selected=\"selected\">\n                    <template is=\"yield\" yield-name=\"keyboard-navigator-content\">\n                        <ul id=\"scope\">\n                            <li>Item 1\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub highlight\">Sub Item 1</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 2</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 3</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>Item 2\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 4</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 5</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 6</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>Item 3\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 7</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 8</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 9</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </template>\n            </lyte-keyboard-navigator>\n        </lyte-popover-content>\n    </template>\n</lyte-popover>\n```\n\n    => In the above example the button with the id \"popover\" is the parent upon which the keyboard navigator functionality will be called and will be given focus.\n    => The scope is the DOM tree element whose children are considered for navigation. Here it is the ul with the id \"scope\".\n    => The list items (li) with class name 'child' is considered for highlighting,as '.child' is only given in lt-prop-children.\n    => Also 'sub item 1' is highlighted by default since it is mentioned in lt-prop-highlighted.\n\nSkip elements\n\n    To skip certain elements while navigating, the specific selctor for those elements has to be provided in lt-prop-skip-elements. By doing so, the respective elements will be skipped and won't be highlighted while navigating.\n\n```html\n<lyte-popover lt-prop-origin-elem = \"#popover\" lt-prop-prevent-focus = \"true\">\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"popover\">\n        <lyte-popover-content>\n            <lyte-keyboard-navigator\n                lt-prop-parent = \"#popover\"\n                lt-prop-scope = \"#scope\"\n                lt-prop-children=\".child\"\n                lt-prop-highlighted=\".highlight\"\n                lt-prop-selected=\"selected\">\n                    <template is=\"yield\" yield-name=\"keyboard-navigator-content\">\n                        <ul id=\"scope\">\n                            <li>Item 1\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub highlight\">Sub Item 1</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub skip\">Sub Item 2</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 3</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>Item 2\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 4</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 5</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub skip\">Sub Item 6</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>Item 3\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 7</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub skip\">Sub Item 8</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 9</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </template>\n            </lyte-keyboard-navigator>\n        </lyte-popover-content>\n    </template>\n</lyte-popover>\n```\n\nHere the elements, Sub Item 2, 6, 8, with the class \"skip\" are not highlighted and skipped during navigation.\n\nOrientation\n\n    The 'vertical' (Up and Down arrow keys) movements can be changed to 'horizontal' (Right and Left keys) movements by changing lt-prop-orientation.\n\n\n```html\n<lyte-popover lt-prop-origin-elem = \"#popover\" lt-prop-prevent-focus = \"true\">\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"popover\">\n        <lyte-popover-content>\n            <lyte-keyboard-navigator\n                lt-prop-parent = \"#popover\"\n                lt-prop-scope = \"#scope\"\n                lt-prop-children=\".child\"\n                lt-prop-highlighted=\".highlight\"\n                lt-prop-selected=\"selected\"\n                lt-prop-orientation = \"horizontal\">\n                    <template is=\"yield\" yield-name=\"keyboard-navigator-content\">\n                        <ul id=\"scope\">\n                            <li>Item 1\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub highlight\">Sub Item 1</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 2</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 3</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>Item 2\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 4</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 5</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 6</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </li>\n                            <li>Item 3\n                                <ul>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 7</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 8</li>\n                                    <li class=\"child sub\">Sub Item 9</li>\n                                </ul>\n                            </li>\n                        </ul>\n                    </template>\n            </lyte-keyboard-navigator>\n        </lyte-popover-content>\n    </template>\n</lyte-popover>\n```\n\nAlso, to limit the keys for navigation in lt-prop-options to [ArrowLeft, ArrowRight] keys, it is mandatory to set the orientation to 'horizontal'.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

is two separate arrays.\n\nUser can select single element and also multiple elements by holding cmd/ctrl or shift keys.\n\nOn hovering the element user can see a +/- icon which also can be used to move the datas.\n\nDrag and drop functionality is also available to move the datas.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- CSS files required -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\"

    "order": 95,
    "content": "Nav\n\nThis is similar to the nav tag of HTML. This UI component creates a group of navigation links.\n\nThis is used in conjuction with menus to create a horizontal nav bar. Vertical nav bars are used as side panels to navigate out to different links.\n\nDependencies\n```javascript\n<-- individual components -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"dist/node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-nav.css\"></link>\n\nalso requires a sprite file - node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/images/lyte_ui_sprite.svg - loaded automatically from CSS.\n```\nHorizontal Nav\n\nYou can create a horizontal nav by simply passing in an array of objects along with the lt-prop-user-value and the lt-prop-system-value . The lt-prop-user-value represents the key in the object that is going to be used as the display label whereas the lt-prop-system-value represents the key in the object which represents the data-value attribute. Here's an example.\n\n```html\n<lyte-nav lt-prop-items={{navItems}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\"></lyte-nav>\n```\n```javascript\n[ {\n    \"name\": \"Module 1\",\n    \"value\": \"mod1\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 2\",\n    \"value\": \"mod2\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 3\",\n    \"value\": \"mod3\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 4\",\n    \"value\": \"mod4\"\n} ]\n```\nCollapsible Nav\n\nNavs are also collapsible. Simply setting lt-prop-type to collapse, collapses the nav into a menu when the width of the rendered items goes beyond a percentage of the width of the lyte-nav tag. This percentage is given by the lt-prop-max-width attribute.\n\n```html\n<lyte-nav lt-prop-max-width=\"80%\" lt-prop-type=\"collapse\" lt-prop-items={{navItems}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\"></lyte-nav>\n```\n```javascript\n[ {\n    \"name\": \"Module 1\",\n    \"value\": \"mod1\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 2\",\n    \"value\": \"mod2\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 3\",\n    \"value\": \"mod3\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 4\",\n    \"value\": \"mod4\"\n} ]\n```\n\nIt is also possible to set a selected value to the nav using the lt-prop-selected attribute. An example is shown below\n\n```html\n<lyte-nav lt-prop-selected={{selected}} lt-prop-max-width=\"80%\" lt-prop-type=\"collapse\" lt-prop-items={{navItems}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\"></lyte-nav>\n```\n```javascript\nnavItems: [ {\n    \"name\": \"Module 1\",\n    \"value\": \"mod1\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 2\",\n    \"value\": \"mod2\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 3\",\n    \"value\": \"mod3\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 4\",\n    \"value\": \"mod4\"\n} ]\n\nselected: \"mod1\"\n```\nCompletely Yielded Horizontal Nav\n\nThe horizontal nav can also be yielded. This includes the menu that is opened when the kebab icon is clicked. Set the lt-prop-nav-yield to true and the lt-prop-menu-yield to true .\n\n```html\n<lyte-nav lt-prop-type= \"collapse\" lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-nav-yield=\"true\" lt-prop-menu-yield=\"true\" lt-prop-items={{navItems}} lt-prop-max-width=\"80%\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"nav\">\n        <% items.forEach(function(item,index){ %>\n            <lyte-nav-item data-value={{item.value}}>{{item.name}}</lyte-nav-item>\n        <% }) %>\n    </template>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"menu\">\n        <lyte-menu-body>\n            <% items.forEach(function(item,index){ %>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value={{item.value}}>{{item.name}}</lyte-menu-item>\n            <% }) %>\n        </lyte-menu-body>\n    </template>\n</lyte-nav>\n```\n```javascript\n[ {\n    \"name\": \"Module 1\",\n    \"value\": \"mod1\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 2\",\n    \"value\": \"mod2\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 3\",\n    \"value\": \"mod3\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Module 4\",\n    \"value\": \"mod4\"\n} ]\n```\nVertical Nav\n\nYou can create a vertical nav by setting the lt-prop-alignment attribute to vertical . The following example demonstrates a vertical nav. The vertical nav renders with two arrows at the top and bottom. The nav is scrolled up or down by moving your mouse over them or by normally scrolling through your mouse wheel. Similar to the horizontal nav, one of the items of the vertical nav can be selected by setting the selected attribute to true in the lyte-nav-item tag. This scrolls the item into view.\n\n```html\n<lyte-nav lt-prop-alignment=\"vertical\">\n    <lyte-nav-item>Home</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Activities</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Feeds</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Leads</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Contacts</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item selected=\"true\">Visits</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>SalesInBox</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Documents</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Deals</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Products</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Quotes</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Solutions</lyte-nav-item>\n    <lyte-nav-item>Campaigns</lyte-nav-item>\n</lyte-nav>\n```\nCustom Nav\n\nYou can create your custom navs by simply changing the CSS of custom elements. For vertical navs, you can create your own arrows by using the lyte-arrow tag. You have to set them as the first and last child of the lyte-nav component.\n\n```html\n<lyte-nav class=\"cyanNav\">\n    <lyte-nav-item selected=\"true\">Overview</lyte-nav-item>\n

    "content": "Navigator\n\nA navigator, a prominent UI component, is used to perform navigation on given list of records.\n\nYou can provide methods for each button. If methods are not provided corresponding buttons will not be displayed.\n\nEach button calls a configured function on click action.\n\nBy default lyte-navigator shows 10 records per page. You can alter it by using lt-prop-perpage.\n\n```javascript\n<-- individual components -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-navigator.css\"></link>\n\nalso requires a sprite file - node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/images/lyte_ui_sprite.svg - loaded automatically from CSS.\n```\nDefault Navigator\n\nWith Yield : To use navigator with yield, you need to provide ltPropYield value as true. It is mandatory to use appropiate class to differentiate icons for home, prev, next and end. You also need to provide {{startRecord}} for starting record value and {{endRecord}} for ending record value.\nWithout Yield : To use navigator without yield, provide ltPropYield value as false. While navigating lt-prop-value will not change. You need to set your desired ltPropValue in the callbacks.\n\n```html\n<lyte-navigator on-next = {{method('next')}} on-previous = {{method('previous')}} on-home = {{method('home')}} on-end = {{method('end')}} lt-prop-yield=true lt-prop-value=\"0\" lt-prop-records=\"12\" lt-prop-perpage=\"10\">\n      <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"navigatorYield\">\n        <div class=\"lyteDoubleBack\"> Home </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteSingleBack\"> Prev </div>\n        <div> {{startRecord}} to {{endRecord}} </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteSingleFront\"> Next </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteDoubleFront\"> End </div>\n     </template>\n</lyte-navigator>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-navigator on-next = {{method('next')}} on-previous = {{method('previous')}} on-home = {{method('home')}} on-end = {{method('end')}} lt-prop-yield=false lt-prop-value=\"0\" lt-prop-records=\"12\" lt-prop-perpage=\"10\">\n</lyte-navigator>\n```\n\n\n\nHere list of rows inside the lyte-table are controlled by navigator.

Use appropiate class to differentiate icons for home, prev, next, end and use paginationRange .\nWithout Yield : To use navigator without yield provide ltPropYield value as false.\n\n```html\n<lyte-navigator on-next = {{method('next')}} on-previous = {{method('previous')}} on-home = {{method('home')}} on-end = {{method('end')}} lt-prop-yield=true lt-prop-value=\"0\" lt-prop-records=\"12\" lt-prop-perpage=\"10\" lt-prop-type=\"simple\">\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"navigatorYield\">\n        <div class=\"lyteDoubleBack\"> Home </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteSingleBack\"> Prev </div>\n        <% paginationRange.forEach(function(column, index){ %>\n            <div data-value={{column}}> {{column}} </div>\n        <% }) %>\n        <div class=\"lyteSingleFront\"> Next </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteDoubleFront\"> End </div>\n    </template>\n</lyte-navigator>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-navigator on-next = {{method('next')}} on-previous = {{method('previous')}} on-home = {{method('home')}} on-end = {{method('end')}} on-select = {{method('select')}} lt-prop-value=\"0\" lt-prop-type=\"simple\" lt-prop-records=\"12\" lt-prop-perpage=\"10\" lt-prop-yield=false>\n    <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n    <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n    <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n    <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n</lyte-navigator>\n```\nBorder Navigator\n\nThis is a paginator with type border ltPropType =\"border\".\n\n```html\n<lyte-navigator on-next = {{method('next')}} on-previous = {{method('previous')}} on-home = {{method('home')}} on-end = {{method('end')}} lt-prop-yield=true lt-prop-value=\"0\" lt-prop-records=\"12\" lt-prop-perpage=\"10\" lt-prop-type=\"border\">\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"navigatorYield\">\n        <div class=\"lyteDoubleBack\"> Home </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteSingleBack\"> Prev </div>\n        <% paginationRange.forEach(function(column, index){ %>\n            <div data-value={{column}}> {{column}} </div>\n        <% }) %>\n        <div class=\"lyteSingleFront\"> Next </div>\n        <div class=\"lyteDoubleFront\"> End </div>\n    </template>\n</lyte-navigator>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-navigator on-next = {{method('next')}} on-previous = {{method('previous')}} on-home = {{method('home')}} on-end = {{method('end')}} on-select = {{method('select')}} lt-prop-value=\"0\" lt-prop-type=\"border\" lt-prop-records=\"12\" lt-prop-perpage=\"10\" lt-prop-yield=false>\n    <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n    <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n    <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n    <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n</lyte-navigator>\n```\nNavigator With Icons\n\nYou can also implement a paginator only with the icons. For this you can specify ltPropShowOnlyIcon as true.\n\n```html\n<lyte-navigator on-next = {{method('next')}} on-previous = {{method('previous')}} on-home = {{method('home')}} on-end = {{method('end')}} on-select = {{method('select')}} lt-prop-value=\"0\" lt-prop-type=\"border\" lt-prop-records=\"12\" lt-prop-perpage=\"10\" lt-prop-show-only-icon=true>\n      <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n      <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n      <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n      <lyte-nav-arrow> </lyte-nav-arrow>\n</lyte-navigator>\n```\nCustomized Navigator\n\nYou can customize the lyte-navigator-icons with ltPropShowText as true and also you can give two icons, one for previous navigation and other icon for the next navigation.\n\n```html\n<lyte-navigator on-next = {{method('next')}} on-previous = {{method('previous')}} on-home = {{method('home')}} on-end = {{method('end')}} on-select = {{method('select')}} lt-prop-value=\"0\" lt-prop-type=\"border\" lt-prop-records=\"12\" lt-prop-perpage=\"10\" lt-prop-show-only-icon=true lt-prop-show-text=true>\n     <lyte-nav-arrow>Prev </lyte-nav-arrow>\n     <lyte-nav-arrow>Next </lyte-nav-arrow>\n</lyte-navigator>\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

For example, a rating component with ltPropType multiple can have any of the two appearances such as smiley(Pre defined rating) or custom(User defined).\n\n```html\nFor ltPropType svg, there are 4 appearances -\n\n1. star (default appearance) - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"svg\" lt-prop-appearance = \"star\"> </lyte-rating>\n\n2. lineStar - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"svg\" lt-prop-appearance = \"lineStar\"> </lyte-rating>\n\n3. heart - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"svg\" lt-prop-appearance = \"heart\"> </lyte-rating>\n\n4. lineHeart - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"svg\" lt-prop-appearance = \"lineHeart\"> </lyte-rating>\n```\n```html\nFor ltPropType multiple, there are 2 appearances -\n\n1. smiley (default appearance) - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"multiple\" lt-prop-appearance = \"smiley\"> </lyte-rating>\n\n2. custom - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"multiple\" lt-prop-appearance = \"custom\"> </lyte-rating >\n```\n```html\nFor ltPropType switch, there are 2 appearances -\n\n1. likeDislike (default appearance) - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"switch\" lt-prop-appearance = \"likeDislike\"> </lyte-rating>\n\n2. custom - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"switch\" lt-prop-appearance = \"custom\"> </lyte-rating>;\n```\n```html\nFor ltPropType toggle, there are 2 appearances -\n\n1. smiley (default appearance) - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"toggle\" lt-prop-appearance = \"heart\"> </lyte-rating>\n\n2. custom - <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"toggle\" lt-prop-appearance = \"custom\"> </lyte-rating>;\n```\n```html\nFor ltPropType class, there is no particular appearance -\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"class\" > </lyte-rating>\n```\n\n\nType-multiple\n\nIn this rating component, different icons are used for each rating icon. In customize type the icon classes are passed as string of comma seperated values. The ith position class is applied to the ith position icon, where i > 0 and i is equal to ltPropCount. eg - lt-prop-empty-icon = \" emptyIcon1 , emptyIcon2 , emptyIcon3 , emptyIcon4 \"\n\ncustom : A rating component using a set icons customized by the users. To customize the icons, user can provide the respective icon classes using properties like ltPropEmptyIcon, ltPropFullIcon, ltPropHalfIcon, ltPropHoverFullIcon, ltPropHoverHalfIcon.\nlt-prop-full-icon : This property sets the given class to rating icons when they are rated full.\nlt-prop-half-icon : This property sets the given class to rating icons when they are rated half.\nlt-prop-hover-full-icon : This property sets the given class to rating icons when hovering over the rating icons.\nlt-prop-hover-half-icon : This property sets the given class to rating icons when hovering over the rating icons and ltPropHalfIncrement is true.\nlt-prop-empty-icon : This property sets the given class to rating icons when they are empty.\nsmiley : A rating component using a set of differnt smiley icons. It has 2 variants based on the ltPropCount value - component with 3 smiley icons and component with 5 smiley icons.\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"multiple\" lt-prop-appearance = \"smiley\" > </lyte-rating>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"multiple\" lt-prop-appearance = \"custom\" lt-prop-empty-icon = \"empty1,empty2,empty3,empty4,empty5\" lt-prop-full-icon = \"full1,full2,full3,full4,full5\" lt-prop-hover-full-icon = \"hoverFull1,hoverFull2,hoverFull3,hoverFull4,hoverFull5\" > </lyte-rating>\n```\n\n\nType - switch\n\nThis component consists of only 2 icons. On selecting one icon the other icon if already selected, is deselected. The icon classes are passed a string of comma seperated values. The ith position class is applied to the ith position icon, where i > 0 and i is equal to ltPropCount. The ltPropCount value is fixed to 2. eg - lt-prop-empty-icon = \"emptyIcon1,emptyIcon2\"\n\nlikeDislike : A rating component consist of a like icon and a dislike icon.\ncustom : A rating component using a set icons customized by the users. To customize the icons, user can provide the respective icon classes using properties like ltPropEmptyIcon, ltPropFullIcon, ltPropHalfIcon, ltPropHoverFullIcon, ltPropHoverHalfIcon.\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"switch\" > </lyte-rating>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"switch\" lt-prop-appearance = \"custom\" lt-prop-empty-icon = \"empty1,empty2\" lt-prop-full-icon = \"full1,full2\" lt-prop-hover-full-icon = \"hoverFull1,hoverFull2\" > </lyte-rating>\n```\n\n\nType - toggle\n\nThis component consists of only 1 icon. It is clearable by default and has the toggle effect like on and off.\n\nheart : A rating component with a heart icon.\ncustom : A rating component using an icon provided by the users. To customize the icon, user can provide the respective icon classes using properties like ltPropEmptyIcon, ltPropFullIcon, ltPropHalfIcon, ltPropHoverFullIcon, ltPropHoverHalfIcon.\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"toggle\" > </lyte-rating>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"toggle\" lt-prop-appearance = \"custom\" lt-prop-empty-icon = \"empty1\" lt-prop-full-icon = \"full1\" > </lyte-rating>\n```\n\n\nType - class\n\nFor this type, classes are used to provide the icons. For different stages in rating like empty, fill, hover specific properties are used to provide the respective class names which will be used then. Custom ratings can be created using class type rating.\n\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"class\" lt-prop-empty-icon = \"lRCustomRatingEmpty\" lt-prop-full-icon = \"lRCustomRating\" lt-prop-hover-full-icon = \"lRCustomRatingHover\"> </lyte-rating>\n\nWith half increment enabled : <lyte-rating lt-prop-type = \"class\" lt-prop-empty-icon = \"emptyIcon\" lt-prop-full-icon = \"fullIcon\" lt-prop-hover-full-icon = \"hoverFullIcon\" lt-prop-half-increment = \"true\" lt-prop-half-icon = \"halfIcon\" lt-prop-hover-half-icon = \"hoverHalfIcon\"> </lyte-rating>\n```\n```html\n// This is the customised CSS for the below rating component.\n.lRCustomRating{\n    background: url(star.png);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-size: contain;\n    opacity: 1;\n}\n.lRCustomRatingEmpty{\n    opacity: 0.5;\n}\n.lRCustomRatingHover{\n    opacity: 1;\n}\n.lRCustomRatingEmpty,\n.lRCustomRatingHover{\n    background: url(circle-outline.png);\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    background-size: contain;\n}\n```\n\n\nFeatures of Lyte rating\nRating Precision\n\nFor ratings with type svg, a new property is defined ltPropPrecision, which will accept values between 0 to 1. Based on this value the rating will be incremented or decremented on hover. \"lt-prop-half-increment\" need to be set true. By default lt-prop-precision is set to be '0.5'.\n\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-half-increment = true > </lyte-rating>\n```\nReadonly Rating\n\nRatings with ltPropReadOnly as true prevents all activities between the user and rating component. It restricts mouseover and click events.\n\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-read-only = true > </lyte-rating>\n```\nClearable Rating\n\nSetting to true/false will allow or disallow a user to clear their rating.\n\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-clearable = true > </lyte-rating>\n```\nRating With Customized Icon\n\nUsers can use their customized icons in rating component. The properties like ltPropEmptyIcon, ltPropFullIcon, ltPropHoverFullIcon should be provided proper class names to show the custom icons. If ltPropHalfIncrement is true, ltPropHalfIcon and ltPropHoverHalfIcon should also have proper class values.\n\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-value = \"3\" lt-prop-empty-icon = \"lRCustomRatingEmpty\" lt-prop-full-icon = \"lRCustomRating\" lt-prop-hover-full-icon = \"lRCustomRatingHover\" > </lyte-rating>\n```\nYield\n\nOn setting lt-prop-type lt-prop-yield as true, you can achieve the yield functionality for the rating component. While using yield, you should also set the lt-prop-type as class. It is also mandatory to define the lyte-rate-icon.Have a look at the below code snippet to see how it can be implemented.\n\n```html\n<lyte-rating lt-prop-yield=\"true\" lt-prop-type=\"class\"  lt-prop-empty-icon = \"lRCustomRatingEmpty\" lt-prop-full-icon = \"lRCustomRating\" lt-prop-hover-full-icon = \"lRCustomRatingHover\">\n   <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"rateIcon\" >\n   <lyte-rate-icon></lyte-rate-icon>\n   <lyte-rate-icon></lyte-rate-icon>\n   <lyte-rate-icon></lyte-rate-icon>\n   <lyte-rate-icon></lyte-rate-icon>\n   <lyte-rate-icon></lyte-rate-icon>\n   </template>\n</lyte-rating>\n```\nEnabling Accessibilty\n\nBy default, aria attributes are enabled.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

First matched element in the document will be associated to the corresponding search element.\n\nsearch - This key indicates the selector of elements to be searched. Text content of these element will be checked with typed value.\n\ntarget - This key indicates the selector of the element to be hidden based on the search results.\n\nIn the following example search is based on the text content of first lyte-td element (selector - lyte-td:first-of-type). Based on the result, target element row ( selector - tr ) will be hidden.\n\nGiving lt-prop-type = 'text' to lyte-search will hide the search icon.\n\n```html\n<lyte-search lt-prop-query-selector = '{\"scope\" : \"lyte-tbody\", \"search\" : \"lyte-td:first-of-type\", \"target\" : \"lyte-tr\"}' on-search = \"\\{\\{method('error')\\}\\}\"></lyte-search>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\nmethods : {\n    error : function ( visibleList , searchElem, inputEvent, inputValue, hiddenList ) {\n        if ( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n        // show some error message\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nRelated\n\nSometimes search may be performed in grouped elements. Normal search won't hide group name even if all of its searchable contents are hidden.\n\nIn this case if the selector of the group is provided in related key search will automatically show / hide group based on the result.\n\n```html\n<lyte-search lt-prop-query-selector = '{\"scope\" : \"lyte-drop-body\", \"search\" : \"lyte-drop-item\", \"related\" : \"lyte-drop-group\"}' on-search = {{method('error')}}></lyte-search>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    error : function ( visibleList , searchElem , inputValue , inputEvent, hiddenList ) {\n        if ( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n            // show some error message\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nSearch in Tree\n\nYou can also search inside a tree. It will open the tree if the matched element is in the closed part of the tree. Scope value should be the top most lyte-tree element. Set the lt-prop-component as tree\n\n```html\n<lyte-search lt-prop-query-selector = '{\"scope\" : \"lyte-tree.someclass\", \"search\" : \"p.value\", \"target\" : \".lyteTreeBodyDiv\" }' lt-prop-component = \"tree\" on-search = {{method('error')}}> </lyte-search>\n\n<lyte-tree class = 'someclass' lt-prop-data = {{treedata}}>\n      <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"content\">\n          <lyte-tree-content>\n              <lyte-tree-icon> </lyte-tree-icon>\n              <p class=\"value\"> {{listValue.name}} </p>\n           </lyte-tree-content>\n      </template>\n</lyte-tree>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\nstatic methods()  {\n  return{\n    error : function ( visibleList , searchElem , inputValue , inputEvent, hiddenList ) {\n        if ( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n            // show some error message\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nSearch in Accordion\n\nYou can also search inside the accordion component. It will open the particular accordion if it is hidden. To search inside the accordian component use lt-prop-component as accordian.\n\n```html\n<lyte-search lt-prop-component = \"accordion\" lt-prop-query-selector = '{\"scope\" : \"lyte-accordion\", \"search\" : \"li\"}' on-search = {{method('error')}}> </lyte-search>\n\n<lyte-accordion>\n  <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n      <lyte-accordion-item>\n            <lyte-accordion-header> Tirunelveli </lyte-accordion-header>\n            <lyte-accordion-body>\n                <li> Tenkasi </li>\n                <li> Ambasamuthiram </li>\n                <li> Alangulam </li>\n                <li> Palayamkottai </li>\n            </lyte-accordion-body>\n      </lyte-accordion-item >\n      <lyte-accordion-item >\n            <lyte-accordion-header> Kanchipuram </lyte-accordion-header >\n            <lyte-accordion-body>\n                <li>Chingelpet </li >\n                <li>Tambaram </li >\n                <li>Madhuranthagam </li >\n            </lyte-accordion-body >\n     </lyte-accordion-item >\n      <lyte-accordion-item >\n            <lyte-accordion-header> Madurai </lyte-accordion-header >\n            <lyte-accordion-body >\n                <li > Melur </li >\n                <li> Tirumangalam </li>\n                <li > Usilampatti </li >\n            </lyte-accordion-body >\n     </lyte-accordion-item >\n  </template >\n </lyte-accordion >\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\nstatic methods()  {\n  return{\n    error : function ( visibleList , searchElem , inputValue , inputEvent, hiddenList ) {\n        if ( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n            // show some error message\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nSearch in Dropdown\n\nYou can also search inside a closed dropdown. To search inside the Dropdown component use lt-prop-component as dropdown. If it matches any, lyte-search will open the dropdown.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown>\n<template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n    <lyte-drop-button>\n        <lyte-search\n          lt-prop-component = \"dropdown\"\n          lt-prop-query-selector = '{\"scope\" : \"lyte-drop-box\", \"search\" : \"lyte-drop-item\"}'\n          lt-prop-appearance=\"box\"\n          on-search = {{method('error')}}>\n        </lyte-search>\n    </lyte-drop-button>\n    <lyte-drop-box>\n        <lyte-drop-body>\n            <lyte-drop-item> Chennai </lyte-drop-item>\n            <lyte-drop-item> Mumbai </lyte-drop-item>\n            <lyte-drop-item> Calcutta </lyte-drop-item>\n            <lyte-drop-item> Delhi </lyte-drop-item>\n        </lyte-drop-body>\n    </lyte-drop-box>\n</template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    error : function ( visibleList , searchElem , inputValue , inputEvent, hiddenList ) {\n        if ( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n            // show some error message\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nSearch in Listbox\n\nYou can also search inside a listbox. Set the property lt-prop-component as listbox.\n\n```html\n<lyte-search lt-prop-component = \"listbox\" lt-prop-query-selector = '{\"scope\" : \".lyteListboxLeftPanel\", \"search\" : \".lyteLBMandatory\", \"target\" : \".lyteListBoxLeftWrap\"}' on-search = {{method('error')}}>  </lyte-search>\n\n<lyte-dual-listbox lt-prop-left-data={{leftPanelData}} lt-prop-right-data={{rightPanelData}} lt-prop-show-toolbar=true lt-prop-associate-parent=\"uniqueKey\">\n        <div class=\"lyteLBLeftWidgets\">\n            <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"leftWidget\">\n              <div class=\"wrap\">\n                <span class=\"lyteLBMandatory\">{{leftWidgetValue.name}}</span>\n              </div>\n            </template>\n            <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"rightWidget\">\n              <div class=\"wrap\">\n               <span class=\"lyteLBMandatory\">{{rightWidgetValue.name}}</span>\n              </div>\n            </template>\n        </div>\n</lyte-dual-listbox>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    error : function ( visibleList , searchElem , inputValue , inputEvent, hiddenList ) {\n        if ( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n            // show some error message\n        }\n      }\n    }\n }\n```\nLabel search\n\nThis is for performing search in grouped elements of lyte-dropdown and lyte-menu. While searching for a group label, search will also provide its group contents eventhough they are not matched in search. Similarly while searching any element inside any group content, the result will be displayed along the group label even if it is not matched in the search.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown>\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-button>\n            <lyte-search lt-prop-query-selector = '{\"scope\" : \"lyte-drop-box.labelSearch\", \"search\" : \"lyte-drop-item,lyte-drop-title\", \"related\" : \"lyte-drop-group\", \"label\" : \"lyte-drop-title\" }'></lyte-search>\n        </lyte-drop-button>\n        <lyte-drop-box class = \"labelSearch\">\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-group>\n                    <lyte-drop-title>Royal dukedom</lyte-drop-title>\n                    <lyte-drop-item>York</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item>Cambridge</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item>Kent</lyte-drop-item>\n                </lyte-drop-group>\n                <lyte-drop-group>\n                    <lyte-drop-title>Non royal lords</lyte-drop-title>\n                    <lyte-drop-item>Wellington</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item>Somerset</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item>Richmond</lyte-drop-item>\n                </lyte-drop-group>\n                <lyte-drop-group>\n                    <lyte-drop-title>Earldom</lyte-drop-title>\n                    <lyte-drop-item>Essex</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item>Huntingdon</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item>Berkshire</lyte-drop-item>\n                </lyte-drop-group>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\nstatic methods()  {\n  return{\n    error : function ( visibleList , searchElem , inputValue , inputEvent, hiddenList ) {\n        if ( visibleList.length == 0 ) {\n            // show some error message\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

You can pass array of strings or array of objects to lyte-step.\n\nFor array of objects you need to mention lt-prop-label ( key which contains the display value for each item ) value in non yieled case.\n\nYou can render lyte-step content's in parent component's scope by using yield\n\nIn onClick callback you can change the selected state\n\n```html\n<lyte-step lt-prop-yield = true on-click = {{method('someMethod')}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-step-structure>\n            <% someArray.forEach( function( item, index ){ %>\n                <lyte-step-item data-value = {{item.order}}>\n                    <lyte-step-body> {{item.name}} </lyte-step-body>\n                </lyte-step-item>\n            <% } ) %>\n        </lyte-step-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-step>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-step lt-prop-label = 'name' lt-prop-data = {{someArray}} on-click = {{method('someMethod')}}> </lyte-step>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\n\ndata(){\n    return  {\n     someArray : prop( 'array' , {\n        default : [\n            { \"name\" : \"home\" , \"order\" : 1 },\n            { \"name\" : \"new\" , \"order\" : 2 },\n            { \"name\" : \"edit\" , \"order\" : 3 },\n            { \"name\" : \"save\" , \"order\" : 4 }\n        ]\n     })\n    }\n}\n\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    someMethod : function ( clickedItem , step , event , data ) {\n        step.goto ( desiredIndex , 'completed' )\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-step>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-step-structure>\n            <lyte-step-item>\n                <lyte-step-body> </lyte-step-body>\n            </lyte-step-item>\n            <lyte-step-item>\n                <lyte-step-body> </lyte-step-body>\n            </lyte-step-item>\n            <lyte-step-item>\n                <lyte-step-body> </lyte-step-body>\n            </lyte-step-item>\n        </lyte-step-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-step>\n```\nArrow step\n\nIn this type each step items are separated by an arrow . You can pass Array of strings or array of objects\n\n```html\n<lyte-step lt-prop-yield = true on-click = {{method('someMethod')}} lt-prop-class = 'lyteStepArrow'>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-step-structure>\n            <% someArray.forEach( function( item, index ){ %>\n                <lyte-step-item data-value = {{item}}>\n                    <lyte-step-body> {{item}} </lyte-step-body>\n                </lyte-step-item>\n            <% } ) %>\n        </lyte-step-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-step>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-step lt-prop-class = 'lyteStepArrow' lt-prop-data = {{someArray}} on-click = {{method('someMethod')}}> </lyte-step>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component's JS file\n\ndata (){\n    return {\n      someArray : prop( 'array' , { default : [ \"home\" , \"new\" , \"edit\" , \"save\" ] } )\n    }\n}\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    someMethod : function ( clickedItem , step , event , data ) {\n        step.goto ( desiredIndex , 'completed' )\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-step>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-step-structure>\n            <lyte-step-item>\n                <lyte-step-body> </lyte-step-body>\n            </lyte-step-item>\n            <lyte-step-item>\n                <lyte-step-body> </lyte-step-body>\n            </lyte-step-item>\n            <lyte-step-item>\n                <lyte-step-body> </lyte-step-body>\n            </lyte-step-item>\n        </lyte-step-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-step>\n```\nBullet step\n\nThis is bullet type step. You can define bullets and its index by lyte-step-head and lyte-step-body tags. If anything needs to be shown inside lyte-step-head use lt-prop-option.

    "content": "Tag\n\nTag UI component, helps the user select values from a list of values on typing into a text element. When the element is not present in the search result a new element is created.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- individual components -->\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-dropdown.css\"></link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-tooltip.css\"></link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-tag.css\"></link>\nalso requires a sprite file - node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/images/lyte_ui_sprite.svg - loaded automatically from CSS.\n```\nBasic Example\n\nThe example below shows the basic implementation of the lyte-tag component.\n\n```javascript\n<lyte-tag lt-prop-options={{items}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-placeholder=\"select a value\"></lyte-tag>\n```\n```javascript\nitems: [ {\n    'name': 'Volvo XC40',\n    'value': 'Volvo',\n}, {\n    'name': 'Audi R8',\n    'value': 'Audi'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Benz SLR McLaren',\n    'value': 'Benz'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Fiat Punto',\n    'value': 'Fiat'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Ford Mustang',\n    'value': 'Ford'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Nissan Titan',\n    'value': 'Nissan'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Skoda Octavia',\n    'value': 'Skoda'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Ferrari F40',\n    'value': 'Ferrari'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Chrysler 300',\n    'value': 'Chrysler'\n} ]\n```\n\nThe tag component starts displaying results as soon as the user types in the text field.\n\nWhen the Enter key or the comma key is pressed, the current item which has navigation is selected. The comma and enter key are the delimiters. When there are no items present, a new tag is created and added.\n\nItems are searched based on the lt-prop-user-value key of each item. This can be changed to search based on other keys in the object usiing lt-prop-search-keys.\n\nThe datastructure of lt-prop-options follow a similar pattern to dropdown. Like dropdown you will need to pass a lt-prop-user-value and lt-prop-system-value which corresponds to the label of each item and a unique value to identify each individual item.\n\nThe lt-prop-selected-list contains the list of all selected values. It is an array of objects. You can also pass lt-prop-selected-list to the component to display an initial list of values.\n\nThis component uses the lyte-dropdown component inside it\n\nUse the updateList and updateOptions utils to update the lt-prop-selected-list and lt-prop-options property.\n\nUsing Other Search Keys\n\nYou can use the lt-prop-search-keys attribute to search based on other keys in each object of lt-prop-options array. The lt-prop-search-keys is an array of strings.\n\n```javascript\n<lyte-tag lt-prop-search-keys='[\"name\",\"type\"]' lt-prop-options={{items}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-placeholder=\"select a value\"></lyte-tag>\n```\n```javascript\nitems: [ {\n    'name': 'Volvo XC40',\n    'value': 'Volvo',\n    'type': 'suv'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Audi R8',\n    'value': 'Audi',\n    'type': 'sports'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Benz SLR McLaren',\n    'value': 'Benz',\n    'type': 'coupe'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Fiat Punto',\n    'value': 'Fiat',\n    'type': 'hatchback'\n\n}, {\n    'name': 'Ford Mustang',\n    'value': 'Ford',\n    'type': 'coupe'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Nissan Titan',\n    'value': 'Nissan',\n    'type': 'truck'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Skoda Octavia',\n    'value': 'Skoda',\n    'type': 'sedan'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Ferrari F40',\n    'value': 'Ferrari',\n    'type': 'sports'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Chrysler 300',\n    'value': 'Chrysler',\n    'type': 'sedan'\n} ]\n```\nDelimiters\n\nApart from the enter key and comma key that are normally used to create a tag, you can also use your own delimiters. In the example below, the space is used as a delimiter to the component.\n\n```html\n<lyte-tag lt-prop-delimiters='[\" \"]' lt-prop-search-keys='[\"name\",\"type\"]' lt-prop-options={{items}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-placeholder=\"select a value\"></lyte-tag>\n```\nDescriptions\n\nEach item appearing in the result after searching a text can also have a description attached to them. To set a description, you need to pass the lt-prop-description-value property which corresponds to a key in the object containing the description.\n\n```javascript\n<lyte-tag lt-prop-description-value=\"type\" lt-prop-options={{items}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-placeholder=\"select a value\"></lyte-tag>\n```\n```javascript\nitems: [ {\n    'name': 'Volvo XC40',\n    'value': 'Volvo',\n    'type': 'suv'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Audi R8',\n    'value': 'Audi',\n    'type': 'sports'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Benz SLR McLaren',\n    'value': 'Benz',\n    'type': 'coupe'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Fiat Punto',\n    'value': 'Fiat',\n    'type': 'hatchback'\n\n}, {\n    'name': 'Ford Mustang',\n    'value': 'Ford',\n    'type': 'coupe'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Nissan Titan',\n    'value': 'Nissan',\n    'type': 'truck'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Skoda Octavia',\n    'value': 'Skoda',\n    'type': 'sedan'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Ferrari F40',\n    'value': 'Ferrari',\n    'type': 'sports'\n}, {\n    'name': 'Chrysler 300',\n    'value': 'Chrysler',\n    'type': 'sedan'\n} ]\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

Use normal table in these cases.\n\nReset scroll to zero before changing the contents of the table.\n\nDependencies\n```javascript\n<!-- individual components -->\n\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-table.css\"> </link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-scrollbar.css\"> </link>\n\n\n<!-- for table navigation -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/components/helpers/tableNavigation.js\"> </script>\n\nThe js file is included in app.js\n```\n```javascript\n<!-- individual components -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/dummy-app-init-for-non-lyte-app.js\" ></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/components/javascript/lyte-table.js\" ></script>\n<script type=\"text\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-plugins/plugins/lyte-scrollbar.js\"> </script>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ui-components/theme/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-table.css\"> </link>\n```\nAnatomy\n\nThe anatomy of a table is as shown below.\n\nSimple structure\n\n\nLet us see the structure of lyte-table\n\nTags Used\nlyte-table - A wrapper for the table content\nlyte-table-structure - It will act as table\nlyte-thead - It will act as table header\nlyte-th - It will act as table header cell\nlyte-tbody - It will act as table body\nlyte-tr - It will act as table row\nlyte-td - it will act as table body cell\nSemantic structure\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-yield = true>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'yield'>\n        <lyte-table-structure>\n            <lyte-thead>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <lyte-th>Item</lyte-th>\n                    <lyte-th>Quantity</lyte-th>\n                    <lyte-th>Price</lyte-th>\n                </lyte-tr>\n            </lyte-thead>\n            <lyte-tbody>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <lyte-td>Notebook</lyte-td>\n                    <lyte-td>2</lyte-td>\n                    <lyte-td>5.00</lyte-td>\n                </lyte-tr>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <lyte-td>Pen</lyte-td>\n                    <lyte-td>5</lyte-td>\n                    <lyte-td>$1.00</lyte-td>\n                </lyte-tr>\n            </lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\nTable syntax - with and without yield\n```javascript\n<lyte-table lt-prop-header = {{headerJSON}} lt-prop-content = {{contentJSON}} lt-prop-header-label-key = \"name\" lt-prop-body-label-key = \"body\"> </lyte-table>\n```\n```javascript\n<lyte-table lt-prop-yield = true>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'yield'>\n        <lyte-table-structure>\n            <lyte-thead>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <%headerJSON.forEach(function(list , indexVal){ %>\n                        <lyte-th> {{list.name}} </lyte-th>\n                    <% }) %>\n                </lyte-tr>\n            </lyte-thead>\n            <lyte-tbody>\n                <% contentJSON.forEach(function(list , indexVal) { %>\n                    <lyte-tr>\n                        <% headerJSON.forEach(function(header , indexVal){ %>\n                            <lyte-td> {{list[header.body]}} </lyte-td>\n                        <% }) %>\n                    </lyte-tr>\n                 <% }) %>\n            </lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\nDefault table\n\nThis is default table. You can either pass data to lyte-table or render your own table by yield.\n\nFor non yielded table you need to pass lt-prop-header and lt-prop-content to lyte-table. Both should be in array of objects format.\n\nlt-prop-header should contain text to be displayed in lyte-th element ( You need to pass the key name in lt-prop-header-label-key ) and the key which should be used for displaying text in table body cell data ( You need to pass the key name in lt-prop-body-label-key ).\n\nIn the following example header label key is mentioned as 'name'. So it will display value corresponding to 'name' key will be displayed in header cells. Body label key is mentioned as 'body'. So value mentioned in body key will be used as key for displaying data in table body cells.\n\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-yield = true>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'yield'>\n

some columns from hiding by marking them as fixed column.\nSet fixed attribute value of lyte-th as 'enable' to make that column as fixed column.\n\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-yield = true

</lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\nColumn sorting\n\nYou can interchange columns if table is sortable. sortSelect class will be added for column being selected for sort.\n\nFor this header cells and body rows should be created by an array data. Same data should be provided to the lyte-table's lt-prop-header property.\n\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-column-sortable = true lt-prop-header = {{headerJSON}} lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-border = true>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'yield'>\n        <lyte-table-structure>\n            <lyte-thead>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                     <%headerJSON.forEach(function(list , indexVal){ %>\n                            <lyte-th> {{list.name}} </lyte-th>\n                        <% }) %>\n                </lyte-tr>\n            </lyte-thead>\n            <lyte-tbody>\n                <% contentJSON.forEach(function(list , indexVal) { %>\n                    <lyte-tr>\n                        <% headerJSON.forEach(function(header , indexVal){ %>\n                            <lyte-td> {{list[header.body]}} </lyte-td>\n                        <% }) %>\n                    </lyte-tr>\n                <% }) %>\n            </lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-column-sortable = true lt-prop-header = {{headerJSON}} lt-prop-content = {{lbind(contentJSON)}} lt-prop-header-label-key = \"name\" lt-prop-body-label-key = \"body\" lt-prop-border = true> </lyte-table>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\n\ndata(){\n    return {\n        headerJSON : prop( 'array', { default : [\n            {name : 'From' , body : 'place', fixed : 'enable'},\n            {name : 'No' , body : 'serial'},\n            {name : 'From' , body : 'place'},\n            {name : 'Name', body : 'name', fixed : 'enable'}\n        ]} ),\n        contentJSON : prop( 'array' , { default : [\n            { place : 'Agra', serial : 1, name : 'Taj mahal' },\n            { place : 'Mysore', serial : 2, name : 'Mysore palace' },\n            { place : 'Tanjore', serial : 3, name : 'Brihadheeswara temple' }\n        ] } )\n    }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-table>\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n        <lyte-table-structure>\n            <lyte-thead>\n                 <lyte-tr>\n                    <lyte-th> </lyte-th>\n                    <lyte-th> </lyte-th>\n                </lyte-tr>\n             </lyte-thead>\n             <lyte-tbody>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <lyte-td> </lyte-td>\n                    <lyte-td> </lyte-td>\n                </lyte-tr>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <lyte-td> </lyte-td>\n                    <lyte-td> </lyte-td>\n                </lyte-tr>\n             </lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\nResizable columns\n\nYou can resize your columns. Adjacent cells were adjusted depending upon selected cell's width. Cell resize will not affect table width. Provide resize attribute of lyte-th as 'enable' to make that cell resizable.\n\nIf resize is enabled, a resize handler will be created inside the lyte-th element.\n\nIn this type of resize while resizing changing table cell width won't affect the outer table's width.

It internally uses intersection observer for fixing and unfixing columns. Currently this is not supported for infinite scroll table.\n\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-sticky-table = true lt-prop-prevent-scrollbar = true lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-border = true>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'yield'>\n        <lyte-table-structure>\n            <lyte-thead>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <%headerJSON.forEach(function(list , indexVal){ %>\n                        <lyte-th> {{list.name}} </lyte-th>\n                    <% }) %>\n                </lyte-tr>\n            </lyte-thead>\n            <lyte-tbody>\n                <% contentJSON.forEach(function(list , indexVal) { %>\n                    <lyte-tr>\n                        <% headerJSON.forEach(function(header , indexVal){ %>\n                            <lyte-td> {{list[header.body]}} </lyte-td>\n                        <% }) %>\n                    </lyte-tr>\n                <% }) %>\n            </lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\n\ndata(){\n    return {\n      headerJSON : prop( 'array', { default : [\n          {name : 'From' , body : 'place', resize : 'enable'},\n          {name : 'No' , body : 'serial'},\n          {name : 'From' , body : 'place'},\n          {name : 'Name', body : 'name', resize : 'enable'}\n      ]} ),\n      contentJSON : prop( 'array' , { default : [\n          { place : 'Agra', serial : 1, name : 'Taj mahal' },\n          { place : 'Mysore', serial : 2, name : 'Mysore palace' },\n          { place : 'Tanjore', serial : 3, name : 'Brihadheeswara temple' }\n      ] } )\n    }\n}\n```\nFull column interchange\n\nThis type of column sort moves entire column instead of single header cell. Use this with sticky table.\n\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-sticky-table = true lt-prop-column-sortable = true lt-prop-prevent-table-modify = false lt-prop-prevent-scrollbar = true lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-border = true>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'yield'>\n        <lyte-table-structure>\n            <lyte-thead>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <%headerJSON.forEach(function(list , indexVal){ %>\n                        <lyte-th> {{list.name}} </lyte-th>\n                    <% }) %>\n                </lyte-tr>\n            </lyte-thead>\n            <lyte-tbody>\n                <% contentJSON.forEach(function(list , indexVal) { %>\n                    <lyte-tr>\n                        <% headerJSON.forEach(function(header , indexVal){ %>\n                            <lyte-td> {{list[header.body]}} </lyte-td>\n                        <% }) %>\n                    </lyte-tr>\n                <% }) %>\n            </lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\n\ndata(){\n    return {\n      headerJSON : prop( 'array', { default : [\n          {name : 'From' , body : 'place', resize : 'enable'},\n          {name : 'No' , body : 'serial'},\n          {name : 'From' , body : 'place'},\n          {name : 'Name', body : 'name', resize : 'enable'}\n      ]} ),\n      contentJSON : prop( 'array' , { default : [\n          { place : 'Agra', serial : 1, name : 'Taj mahal' },\n          { place : 'Mysore', serial : 2, name : 'Mysore palace' },\n          { place : 'Tanjore', serial : 3, name : 'Brihadheeswara temple' }\n      ] } )\n    }\n}\n```\nRow & Column Span\n\nYou can't implement rowspan and colspan directly in lyte-table. In display : table rowspan and colspan are not supported.\n\nLyte-table introduces a new feature named tags support( from 3.91.1 ). In this you can render any custom tags for rendering contents. With this you can render actual td insteadof lyte-td.\n\nWhen td is rendered instead of lyte-td, render this inside a template. do not render it directly. It is not supported in non yieled table. This support is only added in sticky table\n\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-sticky-table = true lt-prop-yield = true>\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n        <lyte-table-structure>\n          <lyte-thead>\n            <lyte-tr>\n              <lyte-th>No.</lyte-th>\n              <lyte-th>Name</lyte-th>\n            </lyte-tr>\n          </lyte-thead>\n          <lyte-tbody>\n            <lyte-tr>\n              <template lyte-if = true>\n                <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-weight: bold;text-align: center;\">Lyte</td>\n                <td style=\"display: none;\"></td>\n              </template>\n            </lyte-tr>\n            <lyte-tr>\n               <template lyte-if = true>\n                  <td>1</td>\n                  <td>Christopher</td>\n               </template>\n            </lyte-tr>\n             <lyte-tr>\n               <template lyte-if = true>\n                  <td>2</td>\n                  <td>Iswarya</td>\n               </template>\n            </lyte-tr>\n             <lyte-tr>\n              <template lyte-if = true>\n                <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-weight: bold;text-align: center;\">Lyte UI</td>\n                <td style=\"display: none;\"></td>\n              </template>\n            </lyte-tr>\n            <lyte-tr>\n               <template lyte-if = true>\n                  <td>1</td>\n                  <td>Anantha</td>\n               </template>\n            </lyte-tr>\n             <lyte-tr>\n               <template lyte-if = true>\n                  <td>2</td>\n                  <td>Suren</td>\n               </template>\n            </lyte-tr>\n             <lyte-tr>\n              <template lyte-if = true>\n                <td colspan=\"2\" style=\"font-weight: bold;text-align: center;\">CRM Client</td>\n                <td style=\"display: none;\"></td>\n              </template>\n            </lyte-tr>\n            <lyte-tr>\n               <template lyte-if = true>\n                  <td>1</td>\n                  <td>Anuja</td>\n               </template>\n            </lyte-tr>\n             <lyte-tr>\n               <template lyte-if = true>\n                  <td>2</td>\n                  <td>Silambarasan</td>\n               </template>\n            </lyte-tr>\n          </lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\nNo.\tName\nLyte\n1\tChristopher\n2\tIswarya\nLyte UI\n1\tAnantha\n2\tSuren\nCRM Client\n1\tAnuja\n2\tSilambarasan\nInfinite scroll table\n\nInfinite scroll table provides virtual endless scrolling to the user. Initially minimum number of rows are rendered in the dom( row count is configurable ) and the same set of rows are used for displaying next set of data. So whenever scroll happens it will just update the data for each rows. It won't render the rows again.\n\nNote : Lyte table maitains same rows by controlling ltPropData. ltPropData is passed from the lyte-table to yield. ltPropData represents the current visible rows. Bind your data to lt-prop-content. Use ltPropData for iterating rows in table yield.\n\nEach row data will be wrapped in an object. You can access row data by using 'body' key. ltPropData will look like this [ { body : actual row data }, { body : actual row data },.... ]\n\nYour body rows should be iterated only with ltPropData. Don't introduce any other template loops for iterating rows.\n\nNote : Dynamic row heights are not supported in lyte-table's Infinite scroll. So all rows should be rendered with same height( If not it will break the table UI ).\n\nWhen all the data are displayed it will trigger scrollEnd callback. You can return additional data in that callback ( or use setValue utility function ).\n\nAny modification done in ltPropContent will reset the table.\n\nIf you want to use some static rows along with infinite scroll table construct your table with lytePreventInfiniteScroll class. Use lyteHidden class for displaying and hiding those filters\n\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-border=\"true\" lt-prop-infinite-scroll = true lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-content = {{contentJSON}} scroll-end = {{method('someMethod')}}>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'yield'>\n        <lyte-table-structure>\n            <lyte-thead>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <%headerJSON.forEach(function(list , indexVal){ %>\n                        <lyte-th fixed = {{list.fixed}}> {{list.name}} </lyte-th>\n                    <% }) %>\n                </lyte-tr>\n            </lyte-thead>\n            <lyte-tbody>\n                <% ltPropData.forEach(function(list , indexVal) { %>\n                     <lyte-tr>\n                        <% headerJSON.forEach(function(header , indexVal){ %>\n                            <lyte-td> {{list.body[header.data]}} </lyte-td>\n                            \\\\use some helpers\n                        <% }) %>\n                    </lyte-tr>\n                <% }) %>\n            </lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-table lt-prop-infinite-scroll = true lt-prop-header = {{headerJSON}} lt-prop-border=\"true\" lt-prop-content = {{lbind(contentJSON)}} lt-prop-header-label-key = \"name\" lt-prop-body-label-key = \"data\" scroll-end = {{method('someMethod')}}> </lyte-table>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\n\ndata(){\n    return {\n      headerJSON : prop( 'array', { default : [\n          {name : 'From' , data : 'place'},\n          {name : 'No' , data : 'serial'},\n          {name : 'From' , data : 'place'},\n          {name : 'Name', data : 'name'}\n      ]}),\n      contentJSON : prop( 'array' , { default : [\n          { place : 'Agra', serial : 1, name : 'Taj mahal' },\n          { place : 'Mysore', serial : 2, name : 'Mysore palace' },\n          { place : 'Tanjore', serial : 3, name : 'Brihadheeswara temple' }\n      ] } )\n    }\n}\n\nstatic methods() {\n    return{\n      someMethod : function(){\n        return [some row data]\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-table>\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n         <lyte-table-structure>\n            <lyte-thead>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <lyte-th> </lyte-th>\n                    <lyte-th> </lyte-th>\n                </lyte-tr>\n             </lyte-thead>\n             <lyte-tbody>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <lyte-td> </lyte-td>\n                    <lyte-td> </lyte-td>\n                </lyte-tr>\n                <lyte-tr>\n                    <lyte-td> </lyte-td>\n                    <lyte-td> </lyte-td>\n                </lyte-tr>\n            </lyte-tbody>\n        </lyte-table-structure>\n    </template>\n</lyte-table>\n```\nFeatures of Infinite scroll table\nFixed column table\n\nRow sorting\n\nEnabling Accessibilty\n\nLyte table will set basic role attributes to table elements if ltPropRole is provided.

Lyte-text uses lyte-tooltip for showing tooltip.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- Individual css files -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/css-variables/ltr/lyte-ui-text.css\"> </link>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/css-variables/ltr/lyte-ui-tooltip.css\"> </link>\n\n// For array of strings displaying\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/css-variables/ltr/lyte-ui-popover.css\"> </link>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/css-variables/ltr/lyte-ui-hovercard.css\"> </link>\n```\n\nThe input content can be a string or an array of strings\n\nString\nText overflow\n\nLyte-text will check its content on mouseenter and sets title for lyte-text tag if its content exceeds its container.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-value = \"Showing long text using lyte-text\"> </lyte-text>\n```\nTooltip properties\n\nYou can directly set lt-prop-tooltip-config to lyte-text.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-value = \"Showing long text using lyte-text\" lt-prop-tooltip-config = '{ \"position\" : \"bottom\" }'> </lyte-text>\n```\nPrevent tooltip\n\nYou can prevent tooltip show even when text overflow ellipsis is applied to lyte-text by setting lt-prop-show as false.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-value = \"Showing long text using lyte-text\" lt-prop-show = false> </lyte-text>\n```\nYielded text\n\nYou can provide yield to lyte-text by setting lt-prop-yield as true.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-value = \"Showing long text using lyte-text\">\n<template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"lyte-text\">\n    <span> Showing long text using lyte-text  </span>\n</template>\n</lyte-text>\n```\nArray of strings\nDisplaying array of strings\n\nIn this you can render array of strings with lt-prop-array through lyte-text. If string contents exceeds its width remaining contents will be shown using a hovercard element.\n\nYield is not supported if array of strings is passed. By default hover card will be shown on hovering prefix element.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-array = '[\"Leads\",\"Contacts\",\"Deals\",\"Reports\",\"Mails\",\"Accounts\",\"Documents\",\"Campaigns\",\"Visits\",\"Projects\"]' style = \"width:500px\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass'&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\" lt-prop-width = 375>\n\t\t\t\t</lyte-text>\n```\nMin count\n\nIf none of the strings in the provided array is not fitting within component's available width, in such case you can display minimum number of strings by setting lt-prop-min-count\n\nDisplayed text will be shown in tooltip( when it gets hovered ) and the remaining items will be displayed in a hovercard.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-array = '[\"Some long text having Leads Contacts Deals Reports Mails\",\"Accounts\",\"Documents\",\"Campaigns\",\"Visits\",\"Projects\"]' style = \"width:300px\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass'&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\" lt-prop-min-count = 1></lyte-text>\n```\nTail text\n\nWith the tail support you can now show ellipsis at the middle of the text. Fixed tail content will be displayed after that. Regex matching the provided value will be consided as the tail text\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-tail = \"\\..+$\" lt-prop-value = \"Some long file name.png\" lt-prop-aria = true style = \"width: 150px\"></lyte-text>\n```\nFill available\n\nIn array of strings if space is available one extra content will be rendered with ellipsis even if that particular item does not fit in that space\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-fill-available = true lt-prop-array = '[ \"Long content\", \"Short content\", \"Very short content\" ]' style = \"width: 300px\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass'&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\"></lyte-text>\n```\n\nLet us also see the result where lt-prop-fill-available is declared as false.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-fill-available = false lt-prop-array = '[ \"Long content\", \"Short content\", \"Very short content\" ]' style = \"width: 300px\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass'&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\"></lyte-text>\n```\nTag rendering\n\nIn this array of strings provided will be rendered as tags\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-tag = true lt-prop-array = '[ \"Lead\", \"Contacts\", \"Accounts\", \"Deals\", \"Reports\", \"Mails\", \"Campaign\", \"Visits\", \"Projects\" ]' style=\"width: 400px;\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass' tabindex = 0&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\"  lt-prop-show-hovercard-on-click = true></lyte-text>\n```\nEllipsis in non lyte-text\n\nYou can use ellipsis & hover tooltip in non lyte-text elements also. Render your text content with 'lyteTextEllipsisNode' class.\n\n```html\n<span class = \"lyteTextEllipsisNode\" style = \"width:150px\">Some long text having long value</span>\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Calendar\n\nCalender component renders a calendar widget allowing the user to pick a date and navigate through the calendar.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- individual components -->\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-calendar.css\"></link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-dropdown.css\"></link>\n\nalso requires a sprite file - node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/images/lyte_ui_sprite.svg - loaded automatically from CSS.\n```\nAnatomy\n\nThe anatomy of the calendar can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\nBasic Calendar\n\nThe lyte-calendar renders the entire month of today's date by default. If lt-prop-current-date is set then the calendar renders the current date. Whenever the calendar is navigated out of today's date, a today button is rendered at the bottom. On clicking it, you are navigated back to today's date. In the example below, a basic calendar that renders today's month is shown.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar></lyte-calendar>\n```\n\nAll dates passed to the calendar need to follow the standard lt-prop-format property. For example, if the lt-prop-format=\"DD/MM/YYYY\", then the lt-prop-current-date property passed to the calendar should have the same format.\nValid value for lt-prop-current-date - 22/04/2022\nInvalid value for lt-prop-current-date - 22/Apr/2022\n\n\nSimilarly, trying to retrieve the lt-prop-current-date after selecting a date in the calendar will yield a date in the same format as lt-prop-format.\n\nThere are few properties which follow the lt-prop-format are:\nlt-prop-current-date\nlt-prop-min-date\nlt-prop-max-date\n\n\nEach of the dates in the calendar have a data-date attribute which contains the full date(The full date is calculated according to the lt-prop-format passed). You can inspect the individual dates in the calendar to find the data-date property.\n\nThe lyte-calendar uses lyte-moment underneath, so all date manipulation functionalities are derived from it. All formats supported from lyte-calendar are derived from it as well. So visit the help doc of lyte-moment plugin to understand the different formats supported in lyte-calendar.\n\nCalendar With Specified Date\n\nAs mentioned above, the calendar can also render the month of a selected date. This is achieved using the lt-prop-current-date attribute. Make sure the value passed to the current date attribute is same as the lt-prop-format. Default format is MM/DD/YYYY.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar lt-prop-current-date=\"03/03/2018\"></lyte-calendar>\n```\nCalendar With Footer\n\nThe calendar can also take in a footer through yield. Use the lt-prop-yield attribute to achieve this.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar lt-prop-yield=\"true\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"footer\">\n        <div style=\"padding: 5px 0px 15px 15px;\">\n            <a>Day</a>\n            <a>Week</a>\n            <a>Month</a>\n        </div>\n    </template>\n</lyte-calendar>\n```\nRange Calendar\n\nYou can also specify boundaries for your calendar. Any dates outside the boundaries are not selectable and are not highlighted. You can set the boundaries using the lt-prop-min-date and the lt-prop-max-date attributes. You can set either one of them as well and the calendar will be rendered accordingly. The format of the lt-prop-min-date and lt-prop-max-date should be same as the lt-prop-format .\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar lt-prop-current-date=\"11/15/2018\" lt-prop-min-date=\"11/11/2018\" lt-prop-max-date=\"12/11/2018\"></lyte-calendar>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-calendar lt-prop-current-date=\"11/15/2018\" lt-prop-min-date=\"11/11/2018\"></lyte-calendar>\n```\nCalendar With Different Navigation Bar\n\nThe lyte-calendar can also use a dropdown to navigate through dates. This is achieved using the lt-prop-header-type attribute. You can set it to dropdown to render a dropdown.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar lt-prop-header-type=\"dropdown\"></lyte-calendar>\n```\nDrilldown Calendar\n\nYou can render a drilldown calendar by setting the lt-prop-header-type attribute to drilldown.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar lt-prop-header-type=\"drilldown\"></lyte-calendar>\n```\nClasses Used\n\nEvery date in the lyte-calendar is wrapped inside a div. And this div has the following classes depending on the date.\n\n```javascript\nlyteCalDiffMonth - When the date is not part of the current viewed month\nlyteCalWeekend - To represent weekends(For now these are just saturday and sunday)\nlyteCalToday - Today's date\nlyteCalSel - Current Selected Date\nlyteCalDisabled - When the date is out of range(lt-prop-min-date and lt-prop-max-date)\nlyteCalCDate and lyteCalTableCell - added to every date\n```\nInteraction With Other Components\n\nThe lyte-calendar can be combined with other components to build complex ui-elements. The example below demonstrates a lyte-calendar in a lyte-popover opened by clicking on a lyte-button.\n\n```html\n<lyte-popover lt-prop-content-padding=\"0px\" lt-prop-show-close-button=\"false\" id=\"calendarPopover\" lt-prop-origin-elem=\"#popoverExample\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"popover\">\n        <lyte-popover-content style=\"padding: 0px;\">\n            <lyte-calendar></lyte-calendar>\n        </lyte-popover-content>\n    </template>\n</lyte-popover>\n\n<lyte-button id=\"popoverExample\" onclick={{action(\"openCalendar\")}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        Open\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n```javascript\nactions: {\n    openCalendar: function () {\n        document.querySelector( 'lyte-popover' ).ltProp( 'show' , true );\n    }\n}\n```\nFoot Notes\n\nUse the on-date-selected callback to perform operations when a particular date is selected. The callback returns the current selected date as an argument. The format of this argument is same as the lt-prop-format.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar on-date-selected={{method(\"doStuff\")}}></lyte-calendar>\n```\n```javascript\nmethods : {\n    doStuff : function () {\n        // Work with the arguments.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSet different formats for your calendar using the lt-prop-format attribute. Head to lt-prop-format to know more about the supported formats.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar lt-prop-format=\"MM/DD/YYYY\" on-date-selected={{method(\"doStuff\")}}></lyte-calendar>\n```\n```javascript\nmethods : {\n    doStuff : function () {\n        // Work with the arguments.\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can revert the calendar back to today's month by making use of the .revertToToday() utility provided in lyte-calendar. Simply query select the calendar and call the function on it. This is same as clicking on the today button of the calendar. The on-navigate callback does get fired when .revertToToday() is called.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-calendar' ).revertToToday();\n```\n\nYou can get the current selected date in lyte-calendar by making use of .ltProp( 'currentDate' ) . Simply querySelect the calendar and invoke the function on it.\n\n```javascript\nvar a = document.querySelector( 'lyte-calendar' ).ltProp( 'currentDate' );\n```\n\nYou can also set the current selected date in lyte-calendar by making use of .ltProp() . Query select your calendar and invoke the function.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-calendar' ).ltProp( 'currentDate', '5/5/2012' ) ;\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

In browsers where it is not supported like IE, use onDownload method to provide your own code to download the file.\nlyteCBoxClose - This identifies the section or icon on clicking which the colorbox will be closed.\nColorbox - With And Without Yield\n\nHere is a sample code given for your reference. You can choose the from the option and see the howw it reflects in any of the examples below.\n\n Default Colorbox - Without Yield\n\n Customized Colorbox - With Yield\n\n```html\n<lyte-colorbox lt-prop = '{\"selectors\":[\"selector1\",\"selector2\"]}' > </lyte-colorbox>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-colorbox lt-prop = '{\"selectors\" : [\"selector1\"]}' lt-prop-yield = \"true\">\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"colorBoxYield\">\n        <div class = \"lyteCBoxOverlay\"> </div>\n        <div class = \"lyteCBoxContent customColorpickerContent\"> </div>\n        <div class = \"lyteCBoxClose\">\n            <svg viewport = \"0 0 28 28\" version = \"1.1\" xmlns = \"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\">\n                <line x1 = \"1\" y1 = \"27\" x2 = \"27\" y2 = \"1\" stroke = \"white\" stroke-width = \"2\"> </line>\n                <line x1 = \"1\" y1 = \"1\" x2 = \"27\" y2 = \"27\" stroke = \"white\" stroke-width = \"2\"> </line>\n            </svg>\n        </div>\n        <div class = \"customHeaderBlock\">\n                <div class = \"customHeader\">\n                    <span>\n                        <img src = \"custom-pic.png\" width = \"40px\" height = \"40px\">\n                    </span>\n                <span> Custom ColorBox </span>\n            </div>\n            <div class = \"lyteCBoxTitle customTitle\"> Title Here! </div>\n            <div class = \"lyteCBoxDownload\">\n                <img src = \"download-arrow.svg\">\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </template>\n</lyte-colorbox>\n```\nAnimation\n\nTwo values can be defined for ltPropAnimation. By default, the colorbox renders without animaiton.\n\n```html\n<!-- Using img tag : -->\n<img class = \"image1\" src = \"../images/someImage1.jpg\" data-lytecbox-title = \"This is an image in img tag\" data-lytecbox-href = \"../images/someImage1.jpg\" data-lytecbox-zoomBy = \"100%\">\n\n<!-- Using a tag : -->\n<a class = \"image2\" href = \"../images/someImage2.jpg\" data-lytecbox-title = \"This is an image in anchor tag\" data-lytecbox-href = \"../images/someImage2.jpg\"> Some Image </a>\n\n<lyte-colorbox lt-prop = '{\"selectors\":[\".image1\",\".image2\"] , \"animation\":\"slide\"}'> </lyte-colorbox>\n```\nSingle Image\n\nSingle image can be displayed using colorbox, if the unique selector is provided to the colorbox via ltPropSelectors property.\n\n```html\n<lyte-colorbox lt-prop = '{\"selectors\":[\"#singleImg\"]}' > </lyte-colorbox>\n```\nGroup Images\n\nProvide a common selector to all the images in a group and pass that selector as a value to the ltPropSelectors property.\n\n```html\n<lyte-colorbox lt-prop = '{\"selectors\":[\".groupImg\"]}' > </lyte-colorbox>\n```\nMultiple Linked Images Using push()\n\nWe can add more images anytime after the colorbox is opened. To add more images we use the push utility function which takes an object or array of objects as argument where obects contains the properties and their respective values required for rendering the files.\n\n```html\n<lyte-colorbox id = \"clrbx\" lt-prop = '{\"selectors\":[\".multiImg\"]}' on-before-open = {{method(\"onBeforeOpen\")}} > </lyte-colorbox>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic methods() {\n    return{\n     onBeforeOpen : function( imgArray , comp ){\n        document.getElementById(\"clrbx\").push( moreImageObjects );\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n // Here, moreImageObjects is an array of other image objects.\n eg. moreImageObjects = [ { lytecboxHref : \"../images/colorbox_pic/collage_1.jpg\" , lytecboxTitle : \"Superman\" } ,\n { lytecboxHref : \"../images/colorbox_pic/collage_2.jpg\" , lytecboxTitle : \"Green Lantern\" } ,\n { lytecboxHref : \"../images/colorbox_pic/collage_3.jpg\" , lytecboxTitle : \"Captain America\" } ]\n```\nData Attributes\n\nBelow are the list of data attributes that should be used to provide data for the files(images or web pages or files like js, css, html) that will be rendered in the colobox. These data attributes should be added to the individual elements that will be opened in colorbox when clicked on. For example check the below code snippet.\n\ndata-lytecbox-type - This property tells the type of the file to be rendered in colorbox. It can have any any of the below given values based on the file type to be rendered.\n\"photo\" - Used for images. This is also the default value. Example - data-lytecbox-type = \"photo\".\n\"iframe\" - Used for files that will be rendered using an iframe in the colorbox for preview. Like - webpages, different types of files like pdf, js, html, css, text, doc etc. Along with iframe you can specify the format of the file seperated by a \"/\", which will be used to display in the thumbnail. Example - \"iframe/js\", \"iframe/css\", \"iframe/pdf\". If no format is specified, then the default format is \"webpage\".\n\"custom\" - Used for file to be opened using editors like ace, CodeMirror etc in the colorbox. You can also specify the format of the file which will be used to display in the thumbnail. Example - data-lytecbox-type = \"custom/js\"\ndata-lytecbox-href - This property is used to get the source link of the file to be rendered in colorbox. For elements like < a > or < img >, if the this data property is not available then the source link will be fetched form the href or src attibutes of these respective elements.\ndata-lytecbox-title - This property is used to display the title or name of the files.\ndata-lytecbox-dlink - For files having data-lytecbox-type value as \"iframe\" or \"custom\", their download links should be provided using this property.\ndata-lytecbox-thumbnail - For files other than images, you can provide their custom thumbnails using this property. Otherwise default icons will be used as their thumbnail. The list of thumbnails will appear at the bottom of the page which are also clickable item.\ndata-lytecbox-thumbnail - For files other than images, you can provide their custom thumbnails using this property. Otherwise default icons will be used as their thumbnail. The list of thumbnails will appear at the bottom of the page which are also clickable item.\ndata-lytecbox-preview - For files other than images, which dont have any preview images, set this property as none. For example if you want to open a zip file in a colorbox you might not want to show any preview image for that zip folder. In that case you can use this feature to show the zip icon or any icon of your choice. Along with this porperty you also need to set data-lytecbox-type as custom.\n\nClick here to see an example\n\n```html\n<a data-lytecbox-type=\"custom/zip\" class=\"custom\" href=\"#\"  data-lytecbox-title=\"Zip Element\" data-lytecbox-dlink=\"http://build/zoho/lyte_ui_component/webhost/V3_0_X/Sep_27_2021_3/Lyte_ui_component.zip\" data-lytecbox-preview=\"none\" data-lytecbox-icon=\"../images/zip-folder.png\" data-lytecbox-alt=\"This file cannot be previewed.\" >Click here to see an example</a>\n```\ndata-lytecbox-alt - For files whose data-lytecbox-preview is set to none, use this property to show the text that will be visible below the icon. The default text shown is - \"Sorry, no preview is available for this file format\". The example shown up also contains custom text that is shown below the preview icon.\n```html\n<!-- Using img tag : -->\n<img class = \"image1\" src = \"../images/someImage1.jpg\" data-lytecbox-title = \"This is an image in img tag\" data-lytecbox-href = \"../images/someImage1.jpg\" data-lytecbox-zoomBy = \"100%\">\n\n<!-- Using a tag : -->\n<a class = \"image2\" href = \"../images/someImage2.jpg\" data-lytecbox-title = \"This is an image in anchor tag\" data-lytecbox-href = \"../images/someImage2.jpg\"> Some Image </a>\n\n<!-- Rendering a web page : -->\\\n<a data-lytecbox-type = \"iframe/html\" class = \"ifCon\" href = \"https://www.wikipedia.org/\" data-lytecbox-title = \"Wikipedia Page\" data-lytecbox-thumbnail = \"https://www.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico\"> Iframe Content </a>\n\n<lyte-colorbox lt-prop = '{\"selectors\":[\".image1\",\".image2\",\".ifCon\"]}'> </lyte-colorbox>\n```\ndata-lytecbox-type - iframe\n\nFiles like pdf, js, webpages are rendered in colorbox using this type.\n\n```html\n<a data-lytecbox-type = \"iframe/pdf\" class = \"ifCon\" href = \"#\"  data-lytecbox-href = \"https://www.ijmter.com/papers/volume-3/issue-8/steganography-using-aes.pdf\" data-lytecbox-title = \"Steganography Using AES\"> Pdf file </a>\n<a data-lytecbox-type = \"iframe/webpage\" class = \"ifCon\" href = \"https://www.wikipedia.org/\" data-lytecbox-title=\"wikipedia.org\" data-lytecbox-thumbnail = \"https://www.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico\"> Wikipedia Page </a>\n<a data-lytecbox-type = \"iframe/js\" class = \"ifCon\" href = \"#\"  data-lytecbox-href = \"https://zmdownload.zoho.com/view?attachId=137868807700180000&entityType=1&entityId=1567587976186100001&accId=4326472000000008001&isRebrandUser=false\" data-lytecbox-title = \"JS File\"> JS File </a>\n\n<lyte-colorbox lt-prop = '{\"selectors\":[\".ifCon\"]}'> </lyte-colorbox>\n```\ndata-lytecbox-type - custom\n\nExample of files rendered in colorbox using this type.\n\n```html\n<a data-lytecbox-type = \"custom/js\" class = \"custom\" href = \"#\" data-lytecbox-title = \"JS file opened using ace editor\"> JavaScript file </a>\n<a data-lytecbox-type = \"custom/css\" class = \"custom\" href = \"#\" data-lytecbox-title = \"CSS file opened using ace editor\"> CSS file </a>\n<a data-lytecbox-type = \"custom/html\" class = \"custom\" href = \"#\" data-lytecbox-title = \"How to embed ACE editor\"> HTML File </a>\n\n<lyte-colorbox lt-prop = '{\"selectors\":[\".custom\"]}'> </lyte-colorbox>\n```\nColorbox Type - image\n\nThis type of colorbox can be used to preview images only.

    "content": "Colorpicker\n\nColorpicker component makes it easy to create, adjust, and experiment with custom colors for the web. It is a non yielding component.\n\nNOTE : To open the colorpicker you need to set the value of ltPropShow as true. Set the value of ltPropShow as true only after setting the values of all other properties you have used for popup type colorpicker. This will make sure that the values passed by you are considered while opening the colorpicker.\n\nColorpicker can be used in 2 ways - either as an inline element or as a popup.\nAs inline : To use it as an inline element, just include the colorpicker element in your html and set ltPropInline to true.\nAs popup : To use it as a popup, we need an origin element based on which the colorpicker will be positioned. Pass the CSS selector of the origin element as a value to the ltPropOriginElement property of the colorpicker. Set ltPropInline to false.

    "content": "Dropdown\n\nA Dropdown, an UI element, allows you to select a value from a list of values.\n\nThere is a subtle difference between a dropdown and a menu in lyte-ui-components. For example, when you want to choose a country from a list of countries, you would use a dropdown. This is different from a menu which represents a list of commands. A menu has a list of commands like Create, Edit, Save, etc. whereas a dropdown is used to make a choice from a list of choices. Menus execute a command in the current context. Menus are only scrollable when they occupy most of the layout port.\n\nDependencies\n```javascript\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-dropdown.css\"></link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-tooltip.css\"></link>\n```\nAnatomy\n\nThe image below describes the anatomy of the dropdown.\n\nTags of the dropdown.\n\n\n\nlyte-drop-button - The button which opens the dropdown list on clicking it.\nlyte-drop-box - The outer container of the dropdown list.\nlyte-drop-body - The body of the dropdown list. This part is scrollable by default.\nlyte-drop-item - Each individual item of the dropdown list. Each item has a data-value attribute that uniquely identifies it.\nBasic Dropdown\n\nA basic dropdown is rendered below.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-selected=\"supplier\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"prospect\">Prospects Found</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"supplier\">Suppliers Found</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"vendor\">Vendors Found</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"influencer\">Influencers Found</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\nEach lyte-drop-item must have a data-value attribute.\nThe lt-prop-selected attribute is used to specify the current selected value in the dropdown. The lt-prop-selected should be equal to the data-value of the item to be selected.\nThere are three ways to yield the dropdown. One is using only the lyte-drop-button, the second is using only the lyte-drop-box and the third is using both the lyte-drop-button and the lyte-drop-box. Everything inside the yield follows the anatomy of the dropdown. The above example has only yielded the lyte-drop-box .\nIf you are using the lyte-drop-box , the lyte-drop-body is mandatory but the lyte-drop-header and the lyte-drop-footer are not.\nIf no lyte-drop-button is specified by the user, lyte-dropdown attempts to get the textContent of the item and place it at the top when it is selected. If a lyte-drop-button is specified, then it is the job of the user to place the textConent above. More on this later.\nIf no lt-prop-selected, lt-prop-placeholder, or lt-prop-display-value is provided, then the first item is the selected value of the dropdown.\nYou can get/set the selected value by using the .ltProp() function.\n```javascript\nvar selected = document.querySelector( \"lyte-dropdown\" ).ltProp( \"selected\" );\n```\n```javascript\nvar selected = document.querySelector( \"lyte-dropdown\" ).ltProp( \"selected\", \"vendor\" );\n```\nDropdown Rendered With Arrays\n\nDropdowns can be rendered with an array as well. This involves not using a yield and simply passing data to the lt-prop-options attribute.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-options={{data}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\"></lyte-dropdown>\n```\n\nYou can pass the following data formats to the dropdown.\n\n```javascript\n[ {\n    \"name\": \"Volvo XC40\",\n    \"value\": \"Volvo\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Audi R8\",\n    \"value\": \"Audi\"\n} ]\n```\n```javascript\n[ {\n    \"Europe\": [ {\n        \"name\": \"Germany\",\n        \"value\": \"de\"\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"France\",\n        \"value\": \"fr\"\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"Spain\",\n        \"value\": \"es\"\n    } ]\n}, {\n    \"Asia\": [ {\n        \"name\": \"India\",\n        \"value\": \"in\"\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"Singapore\",\n        \"value\": \"sg\"\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"Japan\",\n        \"value\": \"jp\"\n    } ]\n} ]\n```\n\nArray of Objects\n\nOpt Groups\n\n\nEach object in the array that is passed to the lt-prop-options attribute should hold the user-value and the system-value.\nThe system-value is the value appended to the data-value attribute of the lyte-drop-item and the user-value is the textContent of each item.\nThe lt-prop-user-value specifies the key in the object which holds the user-value . In the above example, the name key holds the textContent of each item.\nThe lt-prop-system-value specifies the key in the object which holds the system-value . In the above example, the value key holds the data-value attribute's value.\n\nYou can also pass array of strings to the dropdown. In this case, lt-prop-user-value and lt-prop-system-value need not be specified as each value in the array is assumed to be both the system and user value.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-options={{data}}></lyte-dropdown>\n```\n\nThe data format is as follows\n\n```javascript\n[ \"Volvo XC40\", \"Audi R8\", \"Benz SLR McLaren\", \"Fiat Punto\" ]\n```\n```javascript\n[ {\n    \"Europe\": [\n        \"Germany\",\n        \"France\",\n        \"Spain\"\n    ]\n},\n{\n    \"Asia\": [\n        \"India\",\n        \"Singapore\",\n        \"Japan\"\n    ]\n} ]\n```\n\nArray Of Strings:\n\nOpt Group with Strings:\n\n\n\nYou can also pass the content as a mix of array of strings or objects. This obviously needs a lt-prop-user-value and the lt-prop-system-value. Each string is treated as the user-value and system-value.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-options={{data}}></lyte-dropdown>\n```\n\nThe data format is as follows\n\n```javascript\n[\n    \"United States Of America\",\n    {\n        \"name\": \"Canada\",\n        \"value\": \"cn\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"Europe\": [ {\n            \"name\": \"Germany\",\n            \"value\": \"de\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"France\",\n            \"value\": \"fr\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Spain\",\n            \"value\": \"es\"\n        }\n    ] },\n    {\n        \"Asia\": [ \"India\",\n        \"Singapore\",\n        \"Japan\" ]\n    }\n]\n```\n\nMixed\n\nFreeze Dropdown\n\nWhen a dropdown is opened, its background is frozen by default. To prevent this, you can use the lt-prop-freeze attribute. Set it to false to prevent freezing.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-freeze=\"false\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"google\">Google</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"baidu\">Baidu</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"ddg\">DuckDuckGo</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"yahoo\">Yahoo!</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"bing\">Bing</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n\nIn a dropdown with a freeze layer, when it is opened, it caches the current value of the overflow property of the body and adds its own new value (hidden). When it is closed, it adds back the cached value.\n\nWhen the lyte-drop-button moves out of the window boundary, the dropdown automatically closes.\n\nDisabled Dropdown\n\nThe dropdown can also be disabled. Just set the lt-prop-disabled attribute to true.\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-disabled=\"true\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"select\">Select a value</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"qualification\">Qualification</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"needsanalysis\">Needs Analysis</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"valueprop\">Value Proposition</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"decisionmakers\">Id. Decision Makers</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"pricequote\">Price Quote</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"review\">Review</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"closedwon\">Closed Won</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"closedlost\">closed Lost</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n\nSetting Own Display Value\n\nYou can use the lt-prop-display-value to set the textContent of the lyte-drop-button . This works only when you don't yield the lyte-drop-button . The example below, sets the textContent of the lyte-drop-button when an option is selected.\n\n```javascript\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-place-holder=\"select a value\" on-option-selected={{method('setContent')}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"Existing Business\">Existing Business</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"New Business\">New Business</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nmethods: {\n    setContent: function( ev, sel, comp, drop ) {\n        document.querySelector( \"lyte-dropdown\" ).ltProp ( \"displayValue\", \"Roger:\" + sel );\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSetting lt-prop-display-value at the start prevents the dropdown from setting the lt-prop-selected value to the first element.\n\nThe on-option-selected is invoked when one of the options is selected.\n\nPlaceholder For Dropdown\n\nYou can set a placeholder for the dropdown by using the lt-prop-placeholder attribute. When a placeholder is set, lt-prop-selected is not set.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-placeholder=\"select a value\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"exist\">Existing Business</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"new\">New Business</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\nYielded Dropdown\n\nSo far we have seen the lyte-drop-box being yielded in some of our examples. In the start, we talked about how yielding the lyte-drop-button requires the user to place the textContent of the selected content inside the lyte-drop-button (or one of the DOM elements inside of the lyte-drop-button). We will see an example of this.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown on-option-selected={{method('setText')}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-button style=\"border:none;border-bottom: solid 1px #d6d6d6;\">\n            <span>\n                {{initial}}\n            </span>\n            <lyte-icon class=\"dropdown\"></lyte-icon>\n        </lyte-drop-button>\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"js\">Javascript</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"html\">HTML</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"css\">CSS</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"wasm\">Web Assembly</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    setText: function( ev, sel, comp, drop ) {\n        this.setData ( \"initial\", drop.textContent.trim () );\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nThere is a variable called initial defined in the span in the lyte-drop-button .\nEvery time a value is selected in the dropdown, the on-option-selected callback gets fired.\nInside the on-option-selected callback, the textContent of the selected node is acquired and set to the dropdown.\nThis causes a re-render and the dropdown is updated with the selected value.\n\nYou can create an opt group through the yield as well. Here's an example.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown on-option-selected={{method('setText')}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-button style=\"border:none;border-bottom: solid 1px #d6d6d6;\">\n            <span>\n                {{initial}}\n            </span>\n            <lyte-icon class=\"dropdown\"></lyte-icon>\n        </lyte-drop-button>\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-group label=\"Front-End\">\n                    <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"js\">Javascript</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"html\">HTML</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"css\">CSS</lyte-drop-item>\n                </lyte-drop-group>\n                <lyte-drop-group>\n                    <lyte-drop-label>Back-End</lyte-drop-label>\n                    <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"java\">Java</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"sql\">SQL</lyte-drop-item>\n                    <lyte-drop-item data-value=\"python\">Python</lyte-drop-item>\n                </lyte-drop-group>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    setText: function( ev, sel, comp, drop ) {\n        this.setData ( \"initial\" , drop.textContent.trim () )\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nThis dropdown follows the same principles as the previous dropdown.\nA callback is fired everytime an option is selected and inside the callback, the textContent of the node is fetched and placed at top.\nInside the on-option-selected callback, the textContent of the selected node is acquired and set to the dropdown.\nThis causes a re-render and the dropdown is updated with the selected value.\nIn the above example, the lyte-drop-group is going to group lyte-drop-items together. If a label attribute is provided, then a lyte-drop-label element is appended as the first child of the group. Users can also forego this and provide the lyte-drop-label manually in their HTML.\nInteraction With Other Components\n\nThe lyte-dropdown can interact with other components as well. It can interact with a lyte-search component or plugin to produce a search dropdown. Here's an example demonstrating it.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box class=\"countriesDropdown\">\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-header>\n                    <lyte-search on-search={{method(\"showNoResult\")}} lt-prop-query-selector='{\"scope\":\".countriesDropdown\",\"search\":\"lyte-drop-item\"}'></lyte-search>\n                </lyte-drop-header>\n                <lyte-drop-body>\n                    <%countries.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n                        <lyte-drop-item data-value=></lyte-drop-item>\n                    <%})%>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic methods() {\n   return{\n    showNoResult: function ( result ) {\n        if( result.length == 0 ) {\n            if ( document.querySelector( '.noresultstyle' ) ) {\n                return ;\n            }\n\n            var container = document.querySelector( '.countriesDropdown' );\n            var div = document.createElement( \"div\" );\n\n            div.setAttribute( \"class\", \"noresultstyle\" );\n            div.textContent = \"No Results Found\";\n            container.appendChild( div );\n        }\n        else {\n            var noresultdiv = document.querySelector( '.noresultstyle' );\n\n            if( noresultdiv ) {\n                noresultdiv.remove()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nMultiselect Dropdown\n\nA multiselect dropdown allows you to select multiple values from the dropdown list. To render a multiselect you need to use the lt-prop-type attribute and set it to multiple . Here's an example of a multiselect.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-selected={{selected}} lt-prop-options={{data}} lt-prop-type='multiple'></lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\n[ {\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Apples\",\n    \"value\": \"apples\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Berries\",\n    \"value\": \"berries\"\n} ]\n```\n```javascript\n'[ \"oranges\", \"apples\" ]'\n```\nThe data that is passed to the multiselect adheres to all the formats that were described in the Dropdown rendered with arrays section.\nThe lt-prop-selected is a variable of string datatype. Hence the value passed to the multiselect as lt-prop-selected must be string. It is an array which is represented as a string. Eg: '[ \"apples\", \"oranges\" ]'. Check out the Using Selected List section to use the lt-prop-selected-list property, which is an array of objects representing the selected values.\nSetting lt-prop-selected hides the corresponding items in the dropdown list(whether its yielded or not yielded) and places those elements in the drop-button, albeit the lyte-drop-button is not yielded. Further down this doc you will find information about yielded multiselects.\nAdding or removing an item invokes the on-add and on-remove callback but not the on-option-selected callback.\nYou can set/get the lt-prop-selected with the .ltProp() function. Setting it through .ltProp() does not invoke the on-add and on-remove function.\n```javascript\nvar sel = document.querySelector( \"lyte-dropdown\" ).ltProp( \"selected\" );\n```\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( \"lyte-dropdown\" ).ltProp( \"selected\", '[ \"apples\", \"oranges\" ]' );\n```\n\nThe lt-prop-selected should adhere to JSON formats as it is ran through a JSON.parse function. Just make sure you use double quotes to encapsulate each of the values.\n\nThe on-option-selected callback is not invoked in multiselect/multisearch dropdown. Use the on-add and the on-remove callbacks instead.\n\nIt is better to use lt-prop-selected-list instead of lt-prop-selected for multiselects. Check the Using Selected List section.\n\nYielded Multiselect Dropdown\n\nJust like normal dropdowns, multiselects can be yielded as well. Here's a multiselect with only the lyte-drop-box yielded. It more or less works the same as a multiselect with lt-prop-options passed in.\n\n```javascript\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-type=\"multiple\" lt-prop-selected={{selected}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='apples'>Apples</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='oranges'>Oranges</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='bananas'>Bananas</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='grapes'>Grapes</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='tomatos'>Tomatos</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='berries'>Berries</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='papaya'>Papaya</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n\nTrying to yield a multiselect with the lyte-drop-button is the place where things get a little tricky. As you read from the above section, selecting values when the lyte-drop-button is yielded does not place the selected value inside the lyte-drop-button . It is the job of the developer to achieve this functionality. Here's an example.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown on-remove={{method(\"removeFromList\")}} on-add={{method(\"addToList\")}} lt-prop-options={{data}} lt-prop-type=\"multiple\" lt-prop-selected={{selected}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-button class=\"removeBorders\">\n            <%selectedObj.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n                <span class=\"multi-item\" data-value={{item.value}}>\n                    {{item.name}}\n                    <lyte-drop-remove class=\"close-button\"></lyte-drop-remove>\n                </span>\n\n            <%})%>\n        </lyte-drop-button>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { arrayUtils } from \"@slyte/component\";\n // Just as we used the on-option-selected to populate the lyte-drop-button in normal dropdowns, we will be using\n // on-add and on-remove callbacks to achieve a similar result in multiselects\n static methods() {\n     // on-add is called when an item is selected. Use it to populate the selected values of the multiselect.\n     return{\n     \"addToList\": function ( event, current, total ) {\n         // Get all the data of the dropdown\n         var allItems = this.getData( \"data\" );\n\n         for ( var i = 0; i < allItems.length; i++ ) {\n\n             // Find the appropriate item\n             if ( allItems[ i ] . value == src ) {\n                 break;\n             }\n         }\n\n         // Push it into the array of selected items\n         arrayUtils( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ), \"push\", allItems[ i ] );\n     },\n\n     // on-remove is called when an item is removed from the selected list(clicking the close icon). Use it to remove the item from the selected list.\n     removeFromList: function ( event, current, data ) {\n         // Get all selected items\n         for ( var i = 0; i < this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ); i++ ) {\n\n             // Remove the deselected item from the list of selected values\n             if ( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" )[ i ].value == src ) {\n                 arrayUtils( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ), \"removeAt\", i, 1 );\n             }\n         }\n     }\n   }\n }\n```\n```javascript\nselectedObj = [ {\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"Apples\",\n\"value\": \"apples\"\n} ];\n\ndata = [ {\n    \"name\": \"Apples\",\n    \"value\": \"apples\"\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Bananas\",\n    \"value\": \"bananas\"\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Grapes\",\n    \"value\": \"grapes\"\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Berries\",\n    \"value\": \"berries\"\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Tomatos\",\n    \"value\": \"tomatos\"\n},\n{\n    \"name\": \"Papaya\",\n    \"value\": \"papaya\"\n} ];\n\nselected = '[ \"oranges\", \"apples\" ]'\n```\n\n\n\n\nVariables\n\nselectedObj - Initial selected values that needs to be rendered at the top.\ndata - All the items to be rendered in the dropdown\nselected - Your selected list/Array of data-value values that are going to be used to hide the lyte-drop-item .(Remember lt-prop-selected is a string.)\nWhat's Happening?!\n\n\nYou've decided to yield the lyte-drop-button so you are making sure that you render the selected items by yourself. This is shown in the above code.\nYou run a for loop on selectedObj to render the selected values. The name key contains the display value and the value key contains the system value.\non-add gets called whenever an item is selected. Inside on-add , you get the list of all values in the dropdown and find the item which match the selected item and push it inside selectedObj which forces a render. Visually this feels like an item was added to the selected list when an item is selected from the dropdown.\non-remove gets called whenever an item is removed. An item is considered to be removed when the user clicks on the lyte-drop-remove tag. So make sure this tag renders like a close icon. Inside the on-remove callback, you get the selected items and remove the currently removed item from the list. This forces a render and visually feels like the item whose close button was clicked was removed.\nYou pass lt-prop-selected at the start so you hide the already selected items in the dropdown list.\nMake sure you add a data-value to the top level DOM of each item in the selected item list. In the above example its added to the span .\n\nSimilarly, we can yield both the head and the body at the same time. Here's an example.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown on-remove={{method(\"removeFromList\")}} on-add={{method(\"addToList\")}} lt-prop-type=\"multiple\" lt-prop-selected={{selected}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-button>\n            <%selectedObj.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n                <span class=\"multi-item\" data-value={{item.value}}>\n                    {{item.name}}\n                    <lyte-drop-remove class=\"close-button\"></lyte-drop-remove>\n                </span>\n\n            <%})%>\n        </lyte-drop-button>\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <%data.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n                    <lyte-drop-item data-value={{item.value}}>{{item.name}}</lyte-drop-item>\n                <%})%>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\n// Just as we used the on-option-selected to populate the lyte-drop-button in normal dropdowns, we will be using\n// on-add and on-remove callbacks to achieve a similar result in multiselects\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    // on-add is called when an item is selected. Use it to populate the selected values of the multiselect.\n    \"addToList\": function( event, current, total ) {\n        // Get all items of the dropdown\n        var allItems = this.getData( \"data\" );\n\n        for( var i = 0; i < allItems.length; i++ ) {\n            // Find the current selected item in the data list\n            if( allItems [ i ]. value == src ) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Push it into the array of selected items\n        arrayUtils( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ), \"push\", allItems[ i ] );\n    },\n\n    // on-remove is called when an item is removed from the selected list(clicking the close icon). Use it to remove the item from the selected list.\n    removeFromList: function( event, current, data ) {\n        // Get all selected items\n        for( var i = 0; i < this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ); i++ ) {\n            // Find the current deselected item and remove it\n            if( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" )[ i ]. value == src ) {\n                arrayUtils( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ), \"removeAt\", i, 1 );\n            }\n        }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n```javascript\nselectedObj = [ {\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Apples\",\n    \"value\": \"apples\"\n} ];\n\ndata = [ {\n    \"name\": \"Apples\",\n    \"value\": \"apples\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Bananas\",\n    \"value\": \"bananas\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Grapes\",\n    \"value\": \"grapes\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Berries\",\n    \"value\": \"berries\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Tomatos\",\n    \"value\": \"tomatos\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Papaya\",\n    \"value\": \"papaya\"\n} ]\nselected = '[ \"oranges\", \"apples\" ]'\n```\nMultiselects With Search\n\nThis is same as the multiselect dropdown but with a search box provided. You can render this by setting the lt-prop-type attribute to multisearch . Here's an example.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-selected={{selected}} lt-prop-options={{data}} lt-prop-type='multisearch'></lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\n[ {\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Apples\",\n    \"value\": \"apples\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Berries\",\n    \"value\": \"berries\"\n} ]\n```\n```javascript\n'[ \"oranges\", \"apples\" ]'\n```\nThe data that is passed to the multiselect with search adheres to all the formats that were described in the Dropdown rendered with arrays section.\nThe lt-prop-selected is a variable of string datatype. Hence the value passed to the multiselect with search as lt-prop-selected must be string. It is an array which is represented as a string. Eg: '[ \"apples\", \"oranges\" ]'. Check out the Using Selected List section to use the lt-prop-selected-list property, which is an array of objects representing the selected values.\nSetting lt-prop-selected hides the corresponding items in the dropdown list(whether its yielded or not yielded) and places those elements in the drop-button, albeit the lyte-drop-button is not yielded. Further down this doc you will find information about yielded multiselects with search.\nAdding or removing an item invokes the on-add and on-remove callback but not the on-option-selected callback.\nYou can set/get the lt-prop-selected with the .ltProp() function. Setting it through .ltProp() does not invoke the on-add and on-remove function.\n```javascript\nvar sel = document.querySelector( \"lyte-dropdown\" ).ltProp( \"selected\" );\n```\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( \"lyte-dropdown\" ).ltProp( \"selected\", '[ \"apples\", \"oranges\" ]' );\n```\n\nThe lt-prop-selected should adhere to JSON formats as it is ran through a JSON.parse function. Just make sure you use double quotes.\n\nIt is better to use lt-prop-selected-list instead of lt-prop-selected for multiselects. Check the Using Selected List section.\n\nYielded Multiselects With Search\n\nMultiselects with searches can also be yielded just like multiselects. They follow the same principle except that you need to either initialize the lyte-search plugin or component on the lyte-drop-box if you are yielding the lyte-drop-button . Here's an example where only the lyte-drop-box is yielded.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-type=\"multisearch\" lt-prop-selected={{selected}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='apples'>Apples</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='oranges'>Oranges</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='bananas'>Bananas</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='grapes'>Grapes</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='tomatos'>Tomatos</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='berries'>Berries</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='papaya'>Papaya</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n\nYielding the lyte-drop-button of the multisearch is same as yielding the lyte-drop-button of the multiselect. Only difference is you have initialize the search box yourself.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-options={{data}} lt-prop-type=\"multisearch\" lt-prop-selected={{selected}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-button>\n            <ul>\n                <%selectedObj.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n                    <li data-value={{item.value}}>\n                        {{item.name}}\n                        <lyte-drop-remove class=\"close-button\"></lyte-drop-remove>\n                    </li>\n                <%})%>\n                <input type=\"text\" class=\"multi_input\" />\n            </ul>\n        </lyte-drop-button>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { arrayUtils } from \"@slyte/component\";\n // Initialize the search plugin on the input\n $L( '.multi_input' ) . search( {\n     \"scope\": \"lyte-drop-box\",\n     \"search\": \"lyte-drop-item\"\n } );\n\n // Just as we used the on-option-selected to populate the lyte-drop-button in normal dropdowns, we will be using\n // on-add and on-remove callbacks to achieve a similar result in multiselects\n static methods() {\n   return{\n     // on-add is called when an item is selected. Use it to populate the selected values of the multiselect.\n     \"addToList\": function( event, current, total ) {\n         // Get the list of all items\n         var allItems = this.getData( \"data\" );\n\n         for( var i = 0; i < allItems.length; i++ ) {\n             // Find the current selected item in the dropdown's data\n             if( allItems [ i ]. value == src ) {\n                 break;\n             }\n         }\n\n         // Push it into the array of selected items\n         arrayUtils( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ), \"push\", allItems [ i ] );\n     },\n\n     // on-remove is called when an item is removed from the selected list(clicking the close icon). Use it to remove the item from the selected list.\n         removeFromList: function( event, current, data ) {\n             // Get the list of all selected items\n             for( var i = 0; i < this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ); i++ ) {\n                 // Remove the current deselected item from the list\n                 if( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" )[ i ]. value == src ) {\n                   arrayUtils( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ), \"removeAt\", i, 1 );\n                 }\n             }\n         }\n     }\n }\n```\n```javascript\nselectedObj = [ {\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Apples\",\n    \"value\": \"apples\"\n} ]\n\ndata = [ {\n    \"name\": \"Apples\",\n    \"value\": \"apples\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Bananas\",\n    \"value\": \"bananas\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Grapes\",\n    \"value\": \"grapes\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Berries\",\n    \"value\": \"berries\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Tomatos\",\n    \"value\": \"tomatos\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Papaya\",\n    \"value\": \"papaya\"\n} ]\n\nselected = '[ \"oranges\", \"apples\" ]'\n```\n\n\n\n\nVariables\n\nselectedObj - Initially selected values that needs to be rendered at the top.\ndata - All the items to be rendered in the dropdown\nselected - Your selected list/Array of data-value values that are going to be used to hide the lyte-drop-item .(Remember lt-prop-selected is a string.)\n\nWhat's Happening?!\n\nNothing really. You've decided to yield the lyte-drop-button so you are making sure that you render the selected items by yourself. This is shown in the above code.\nYou run a for loop on selectedObj to render the selected values. The name key contains the display value and the value key contains the system value.\non-add gets called whenever an item is selected. Inside on-add , you get the list of all values in the dropdown and find the item which match the selected item and push it inside selectedObj which forces a render. Visually this feels like an item was added to the selected list when an item is selected from the dropdown.\non-remove gets called whenever an item is removed. An item is considered to be removed when the user clicks on the lyte-drop-remove tag. So make sure this tag renders like a close icon. Inside the on-remove callback, you get the selected items and remove the currently removed item from the list. This forces a render and visually feels like the item whose close button was clicked was removed.\nYou pass lt-prop-selected at the start so you hide the already selected items in the dropdown list.\nMake sure you add a data-value to the top level DOM of each item in the selected item list. In the above example its added to the span .\n\nSince you have initialized the search plugin yourself. You have to create the no results found div yourself in the on-search callback. This also means that you need to show the no results found div on selecting all the items.\n\nSimilarly, we can yield both the head and the body at the same time. Here's an example.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-type=\"multisearch\" lt-prop-selected={{selected}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-button>\n            <ul>\n                <%selectedObj.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n                    <li data-value={{item.value}}>\n                        {{item.name}}\n                        <lyte-drop-remove class=\"close-button\"></lyte-drop-remove>\n                    </li>\n                <%})%>\n                <input type=\"text\" class=\"multi_input\" />\n            </ul>\n        </lyte-drop-button>\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <%data.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n                    <lyte-drop-item data-value={{item.value}}>{{item.name}}</lyte-drop-item>\n                <%})%>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\n// Initialize the search plugin on the input\n$L( '.multi_input' ). search( {\n    \"scope\": '.multi_input',\n    \"search\": \"lyte-drop-item\"\n} );\n\n// Just as we used the on-option-selected to populate the lyte-drop-button in normal dropdowns, we will be using\n// on-add and on-remove callbacks to achieve a similar result in multiselects\nstatic methods() {\n  return{\n    // on-add is called when an item is selected. Use it to populate the selected values of the multiselect.\n    \"addToList\": function( event, current, total ) {\n        // Get the list of all items in the dropdown\n        var allItems = this.getData( \"data\" );\n\n        for( var i = 0; i < allItems.length; i++ ) {\n            // Find the current selected item in the list\n            if( allItems [ i ]. value == src ) {\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Push it into the array of selected items\n        arrayUtils( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ), \"push\", allItems [ i ] );\n    },\n\n    // on-remove is called when an item is removed from the selected list(clicking the close icon). Use it to remove the item from the selected list.\n    removeFromList: function( event, current, data ) {\n        // Get the list of all selected items\n        for( var i = 0; i < this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ); i++ ) {\n            // Remove the current deselected item from the list\n            if( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" )[ i ]. value == src ) {\n                arrayUtils( this.getData( \"selectedObj\" ), \"removeAt\", i, 1 );\n            }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n```javascript\nselectedObj = [ {\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Apples\",\n    \"value\": \"apples\"\n} ];\n\ndata = [ {\n    \"name\": \"Apples\",\n    \"value\": \"apples\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Oranges\",\n    \"value\": \"oranges\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Bananas\",\n    \"value\": \"bananas\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Grapes\",\n    \"value\": \"grapes\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Berries\",\n    \"value\": \"berries\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Tomatos\",\n    \"value\": \"tomatos\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Papaya\",\n    \"value\": \"papaya\"\n} ];\n\nselected = '[ \"oranges\", \"apples\" ]'\n```\n\nThe no results found option will be displayed everytime the number of visible lyte-drop-items are zero except for multiselects with search when the lyte-drop-button is yielded. In this case, the developer has to do it.\n\nUsing Selected List\n\nTo process the selected values, a new property lt-prop-selected-list has been introduced which makes it more easier to process selected values. The lt-prop-selected-list is an array of objects which are selected in a multiselect or a multisearch. The object here represents the particular object in lt-prop-options which corresponds to the selected value. An example is shown below\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-type=\"multiple\" lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-options={{basicdata}} lt-prop-selected-list={{selList}}>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <% basicdata.forEach(function(item,index) { %>\n                     <lyte-drop-item data-value={{item.value}}>{{item.name}} </lyte-drop-item>\n                 <% } ) %>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nbasicdata: [ {\n    \"name\": \"Volvo XC40\",\n    \"value\": \"Volvo\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Audi R8\",\n    \"value\": \"Audi\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Benz SLR McLaren\",\n    \"value\": \"Benz\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Fiat Punto\",\n    \"value\": \"Fiat\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Ford Mustang\",\n    \"value\": \"Ford\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Nissan Titan\",\n    \"value\": \"Nissan\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Skoda Octavia\",\n    \"value\": \"Skoda\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Ferrari F40\",\n    \"value\": \"Ferrari\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Chrysler 300\",\n    \"value\": \"Chrysler\"\n} ]\n\nselList:[ {\n    \"name\": \"Volvo XC40\",\n    \"value\": \"Volvo\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Audi R8\",\n    \"value\": \"Audi\"\n} ]\n```\n\nIn the above example, it can be seen that basicdata is both passed to the lyte-dropdown and also used to iterate in the yield. This is necessary. You can also see that lt-prop-user-value and lt-prop-system-value is also passed to the dropdown. The selList is the set of selected values that the dropdown must render with. You can lbind it. The lt-prop-selected-list holds the current selected values in the dropdown.\n\nAvoid passing lt-prop-user-value or lt-prop-system-value when lt-prop-options is not passed to the dropdown. This can break the dropdown.\n\nYou can also try the same dropdown without yield\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-type=\"multiple\" lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\" lt-prop-options={{basicdata}} lt-prop-selected-list={{selList}}>\n\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nbasicdata: [ {\n    \"name\": \"Volvo XC40\",\n    \"value\": \"Volvo\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Audi R8\",\n    \"value\": \"Audi\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Benz SLR McLaren\",\n    \"value\": \"Benz\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Fiat Punto\",\n    \"value\": \"Fiat\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Ford Mustang\",\n    \"value\": \"Ford\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Nissan Titan\",\n    \"value\": \"Nissan\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Skoda Octavia\",\n    \"value\": \"Skoda\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Ferrari F40\",\n    \"value\": \"Ferrari\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Chrysler 300\",\n    \"value\": \"Chrysler\"\n} ]\n\nselList:[ {\n    \"name\": \"Volvo XC40\",\n    \"value\": \"Volvo\"\n}, {\n    \"name\": \"Audi R8\",\n    \"value\": \"Audi\"\n} ]\n```\nDropdown With Callout\n\nDropdowns can have callouts as well. You just have to set the lt-prop-callout attribute to true .\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-callout=\"true\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='acquired'>Acquired</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='active'>Active</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='marketfailed'>Market Failed</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='projectcancelled'>Project Cancelled</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='shutdown'>Shutdown</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\nHover Dropdown\n\nDropdowns can be opened on hover as well. You just have to set the lt-prop-hover attribute to true .\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-hover=\"true\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='other'>Other</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='private'>Private</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='public'>Public</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='subsidiary'>Subsidiary</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\nPositioned Dropdown\n\nYou can position the dropdown in any of the four directions - up, down, left, right. Use the lt-prop-position attribute to position the dropdown in a particular direction.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown lt-prop-position=\"right\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='edit'>Edit</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='delete'>Delete</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='rename'>Rename</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='modified'>Modified</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='setperm'>Set permission language related data</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='editprop'>Edit Properties</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='create'>Create</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='save'>Save</lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='update'>Update</lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

If in case, the element is yet to render or is currently unavailable, kindly ensure to pass \" \" or 'undefined' instead of \"#undefined\" .\n\nOn using hover card on multiple nodes, make sure that you have unique selector for each node.\n\nHovercard With Auto Show\n\nYou can also show a hovercard automatically on mouse enter of the origin element without adding event handler by setting ltPropAutoShow as true and add lyte-hovercard attribute as true in origin element. If auto-show is set to false you need to handle the display of hovercard by setting lt-prop-show as true on mouse enter\n\nNote : It is mandatory to add lyte-hovercard attribute as true in origin element\n\n```html\n<lyte-hovercard  lt-prop-auto-show = true id =\"hovercard\" lt-prop-origin-elem=\"lyte-button#button\">\n  <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"hoverCardYield\">\n    <lyte-hovercard-content>\n     <p>  A hovercard is useful for displaying additional info/content associated to an element  </p>\n    </lyte-hovercard-content>\n   </template>\n</lyte-hovercard>\n<lyte-button id=\"button\" lyte-hovercard=true>\n  <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">Default </template>\n  </lyte-button>\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Menu\n\nA menu, an UI element, is a group of options available to perform some reasonable actions in the page. You can use event such as click, mouse enter, dbclick, context menu and define them using lt-prop-event.\n\nA menu component is different from the Dropdown. If you intend to select an option from group of options use dropdown.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-menu.css\"></link>\n```\nAnatomy\n\nThe anatomy of a menu is as shown below.\n\nTags of the menu.\n\n\n\nlyte-menu-body - outer container\nlyte-menu-item - each list item\nlyte-menu-description - sub display value\nlyte-menu-label - main display value\nlyte-menu-group - separator of each menu group\nlyte-menu-header - header of menu group\nDefault menu\n\nDefault menu opens on click event. It can be opened on valid javascript events like click, dblclick, mouseenter, contextmenu.\n\nNo need to make ltPropShow as true in lyte-menu. Lyte menu itself opens menu based on the triggered event. If the event's traverse path matches with lt-prop-query (valid dom selector) menu will be opened.\n\nYou can pass array of strings or array of objects for non yielded menu. In array of objects you need to specify which key contains main display value using lt-prop-user-value and additional information to be displayed using lt-prop-description.\n\nIn yielded menu all the contents of the menu will be rendered in parent component's scope. Elements rendered inside the yield will be used as menu content.\n\nTo disable a particular menu item you can set lt-prop-disabled = \"true\" to that particular menu item. It is not supported in non yielded menu.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button id = 'demo'>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'text'>\n       click here\n   </template>\n</lyte-button>\n\n<lyte-menu lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-event = 'click' lt-prop-query = 'lyte-button#demo'>\n <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n    <lyte-menu-body>\n         <% someArray.forEach( function( item, index ){ %>\n            <lyte-menu-item data-value = {{item.name}}>\n                <lyte-menu-label>{{item.name}} </lyte-menu-label>\n                <lyte-menu-description>{{item.key}} </lyte-menu-description>\n            </lyte-menu-item>\n         <% }) %>\n    </lyte-menu-body>\n  </template>\n </lyte-menu>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-button id = 'demo'>\n<template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'text'>\n    Click here\n</template>\n</lyte-button>\n\n<lyte-menu lt-prop-description = 'key' lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-user-value = 'name' lt-prop-event = 'click' lt-prop-query = 'lyte-button#demo'>\n</lyte-menu>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component JS\n\n data() {\n  return {\n      someArray : prop ( 'array' , { default : [\n          { \"name\" : \"New File ...\" , \"key\" : \"Ctrl + N\" },\n          { \"name\" : \"Open File....\" , \"key\" : \"Ctrl + O\" }\n      ]\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-menu>\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n        <lyte-menu-body>\n            <lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-label></lyte-menu-label>\n                <lyte-menu-description></lyte-menu-description>\n            </lyte-menu-item>\n            <lyte-menu-item>\n            <lyte-menu-label></lyte-menu-label>\n            <lyte-menu-description></lyte-menu-description>\n            </lyte-menu-item>\n        </lyte-menu-body>\n    </template>\n</lyte-menu>\n```\nMenu for multiple elements\n\nYou can bind a single lyte-menu for multiple elements. All of your menu origin elements should match with lt-prop-query.\n\nlt-prop-query-class ( default = 'lyteMenuSelected' ) will be added to the menu's current origin element when menu is opened. The same will be removed when menu is closed.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button class = 'someClass'>\n<template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'text'>\nElement1\n</template>\n</lyte-button>\n\n<span class = \"someClass\">\nElement2\n</span>\n\n<lyte-menu lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-event = 'click' lt-prop-query = '.someClass'>\n<template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n<lyte-menu-body>\n    <% someArray.forEach( function( item, index ){ %>\n         <lyte-menu-item data-value = {{item.name}}>\n            {{item.name}}\n         <lyte-menu-description>\n            {{item.key}}\n         </lyte-menu-description>\n    </lyte-menu-item>\n<%})%>\n</lyte-menu-body>\n</template>\n</lyte-menu>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-button class = 'someClass'>\n<template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'text'>\nElement1\n</template>\n</lyte-button>\n\n<span class = \"someClass\">\nElement2\n</span>\n\n<lyte-menu lt-prop-freeze = false lt-prop-description = 'key' lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-user-value = 'name' lt-prop-event = 'click' lt-prop-query = '.someClass'></lyte-menu>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component JS\n\ndata() {\n  return {\n    someArray : prop ( 'array' : { default : [\n        { \"name\" : \"New File ...\" , \"key\" : \"Ctrl + N\" },\n        { \"name\" : \"Open File....\" , \"key\" : \"Ctrl + O\" }\n      ]\n    })\n  }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-menu>\n<template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n<lyte-menu-body>\n    <lyte-menu-item></lyte-menu-item>\n    <lyte-menu-item></lyte-menu-item>\n    </lyte-menu-body>\n</template>\n</lyte-menu>\n```\nMenu with grouping\n\nMenu items can be grouped.

Menu having origin element matches lyte-menu-item will be considered as sub menu.\n\nFor aria keyboard navigation provide selector of sub menu element in parent origin element's lyte-sub-menu attribute.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button id = 'sub'>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'text'>\n        click here\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n\n<lyte-menu lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-callout = true lt-prop-query = 'lyte-button#sub'>\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n        <lyte-menu-body class = \"someArray\">\n            <% someArray.forEach( function( item, index ){ %>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value = {{item.name}}>\n                    <lyte-menu-label>{{item.name}} </lyte-menu-label>\n                    <lyte-menu-description>{{item.key}} </lyte-menu-description>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n            <% }) %>\n        </lyte-menu-body>\n    </template>\n</lyte-menu>\n\n<lyte-menu id = \"submenu\" lt-prop-position = \"right\" lt-prop-event = \"mouseenter\" lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-callout = true lt-prop-query = '.someArray lyte-menu-item:nth-of-type(3)'>\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n        <lyte-menu-body class = \"someClass\">\n            <% someArray.forEach( function( item, index ){ %>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value = {{item.name}}>\n                    <lyte-menu-label>{{item.name}} </lyte-menu-label>\n                    <lyte-menu-description>{{item.key}} </lyte-menu-description>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n            <% }) %>\n        </lyte-menu-body>\n    </template>\n</lyte-menu>\n\n// sub menu attribute for aria\n<lyte-menu-item lyte-sub-menu = \"#submenu\"></lyte-menu-item>\n```\n```html\n<lyte-button id = 'demo'>\n    <template is = 'registerYield' yield-name = 'text'>\n        click here\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n\n<lyte-menu lt-prop-wrapper-class = \"menuBoxClass\" lt-prop-content = {{someArray}} lt-prop-user-value = 'name' lt-prop-query = '.someClass'></lyte-menu>\n\n<lyte-menu lt-prop-position = \"right\" lt-prop-event = \"mouseenter\" lt-prop-callout = true lt-prop-position = 'right' lt-prop-content = {{someArray1}} lt-prop-user-value = 'name' lt-prop-query = '.menuBoxClass lyte-menu-item:nth-of-type(3)'></lyte-menu>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component JS\n\n data() {\n    return {\n      someArray : prop ( 'array' : { default : [\n          { \"name\" : \"New File ...\", \"key\" : \"Ctrl + N\" },\n          { \"name\" : \"Open File....\", \"key\" : \"Ctrl + O\" }\n      ] } ),\n\n      someArray1 : prop( 'array' : { default : [\n          { \"name\" : \"New File ...\", \"key\" : \"Ctrl + N\" },\n          { \"name\" : \"Open File....\", \"key\" : \"Ctrl + O\" }\n       ] } )\n    }\n}\n```\n```html\n<lyte-menu>\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n        <lyte-menu-body>\n            <lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-label></lyte-menu-label>\n                 <lyte-menu-description></lyte-menu-description>\n            </lyte-menu-item>\n            <lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-label></lyte-menu-label>\n                <lyte-menu-description></lyte-menu-description>\n            </lyte-menu-item>\n        </lyte-menu-body>\n    </template>\n</lyte-menu>\n```\nAccordion menu\n\nBy using the class 'lyteMenuAccordionItem', you can set the menu items like an accordion . In other words, you can render the menu items in the corresponding node with the 'lyteMenuAccordionItem' class just like the below code.\n\n```html\n<lyte-menu lt-prop-class=\"menuBoxClass\" lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-event = 'click' lt-prop-query = 'lyte-button#demo' >\n    <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"yield\">\n        <lyte-menu-body>\n            <% data.forEach( function( item, index ){ %>\n                <%if(!item.group){%>\n                    <lyte-menu-item data-value = {{item.name}} tabindex=\"0\">\n                        <lyte-menu-label>{{item.name}} </lyte-menu-label>\n                        <lyte-menu-description>{{item.key}} </lyte-menu-description>\n                    </lyte-menu-item>\n                <%}else{%>\n                    <lyte-menu-item data-value = {{item.name}}class=\"lyteMenuAccordionContainer lyteMenuAccordionClosed\" tabindex=\"0\" data-associate-click=\".inputCheck\" >\n                        <lyte-menu-label>{{item.name}}</lyte-menu-label>\n                        <div class=\"lyteMenuAccordionItem\">\n                            <%item.group.forEach( function(item){%>\n                                <lyte-menu-item data-value = {{item.name}} tabindex=\"0\">\n                                    <lyte-menu-label>{{item.name}}</lyte-menu-label>\n                                    <lyte-menu-description>{{item.key}} </lyte-menu-description>\n                                </lyte-menu-item>\n                            <%})%>\n                            </div>\n                    </lyte-menu-item>\n                <%}%>\n            <% }) %>\n        </lyte-menu-body>\n        </template>\n    </lyte-menu>\n```\n```javascript\n// in your component\n\n data() {\n    return {\n        data : Lyte.attr ( 'array' , { default : [\n            { \"name\" : \"New File...\", \"key\": \"Ctrl + N\" },\n            { \"name\" : \"Open File...\", \"key\": \"Ctrl + O\" },\n            { \"name\" : \"Open Folder...\", \"key\": \"Ctrl + N\" },\n            { \"name\" : \"Save\" , \"group\" : [\n                { \"name\" : \"Save As\", \"key\": \"Ctrl + Shift + N\" },\n                { \"name\" : \"Save All\", \"key\": \"\" },\n                { \"name\" : \"Save Selection\" },\n                { \"name\" : \"Save as New File\" }\n             ] },\n            { \"name\" : \"Close File\", \"key\": \"Ctrl + W\" }\n            ]\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

By default animation is set to slide from top and duration is 0.5s.\nThe options provided for animation property are -\n\nslideFromTop : By setting this value, the modal when opened, slides down from the top of the window and gets fixed to a position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property. And when closed, the modal starts sliding upwards from that position and disappears.\nslideFromBottom : By setting this value, the modal when opened, slides up from the bottom of the window and gets fixed to a position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property. Similarly when closed, the modal starts sliding downwards and disappears.\nslideFromLeft : By setting this value, the modal when opened, appears sliding from the left side of the window and gets fixed to a position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property. Similarly when closed, the modal starts sliding sidewise towards left and disappears.\nslideFromRight : By setting this value, the modal when opened, appears sliding from the right side of the window and gets fixed to a position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property.Similarly when closed, the modal starts sliding sidewise towards right and disappears.\nfadeIn : By setting this value, the modal when opened, fades in at the position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property. Similarly when closed, the modal fades out and disappears.\nzoom : By setting this value, the modal opens with zoom in animation and closes, with zoom out animation. If originElement is provided then the animation will happen based on the originElement's position. originElement is optional.\n```javascript\nvar modalElement = document.getElementById(\"modalElem\");\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"transition\",{\"animation\":\"slideFromRight\",\"duration\":\"0.6\"});\n\nFor zoom with originElement -\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"transition\",{\"animation\":\"zoom\",\"duration\":\"0.6\",\"originElement\":\"#selector\"});\n\nFor zoom without originElement -\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"transition\",{\"animation\":\"zoom\",\"duration\":\"0.6\"});\n```\nFreeze\n\nSetting freeze false, will open a modaless modal. Dimmer will not be applied and backround view will be accessible. By default freeze will be true.\nNote : By default non-freezed modal will have inner scroll in the content area, if the modal's height/width exceeds the document's height/width.\n\n```javascript\nvar modalElement = document.getElementById(\"modalElem\");\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"freeze\",true);\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"freeze\",false);\n```\nOffset\n\nOffset property will help you to position the modal relative to the body. You can specify top and left offset for the modal using this property. \"%\" and \"px\" units are supported and you can also give 'center' if you want to position it in the center.\nNOTE: If Right and Bottom values present, it will override Left and Top values.\n\n```javascript\nvar modalElement = document.getElementById(\"modalElem\");\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"offset\",{\"top\":\"20px\",\"left\":\"center\"});\n```\nDraggable - Scrollable\n\nCheck the below checkboxes to make the modal draggable or scrollable.\n\n```javascript\nvar modalElement = document.getElementById(\"modalElem\");\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"draggable\",true);\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"scrollable\",true);\n```\nSet Content Height\n\nltPropSetContentHeight is a boolean property which determines if the content of the modal will have some fixed height or not. This property is helpful when you have set some height for the modal component. Toggle the below true/false value to check the difference.\n\n```html\n<lyte-modal lt-prop-set-content-height=\"true\" ></lyte-modal>\n```\nOverlap Modal\n\nltPropOverlapModal is a boolean property that determines if the incoming modal will be rendered sidewise or it will overlap the existing modal.\n\n```html\n<lyte-modal lt-prop-overlap-modal=\"true\" ></lyte-modal>\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

Also make sure to provide the lt-prop-yield value as true while using the yield.\n\n```html\n<lyte-multi-dropdown lt-prop-data=\"{{dropData}}\" lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\"  lt-prop-yield=\"true\" lt-prop-selected=\"{{selData}}\" on-add=\"{{method(\"add\")}}\" on-remove=\"{{method(\"remove\")}}\" >\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-button >\n            <%selectedList.forEach(function(item,index){%>\n                <span data-value={{item}}>\n                    {{item}}\n                </span>\n            <%})%>\n        </lyte-drop-button>\n    </template>\n</lyte-multi-dropdown >\n```\n```javascript\ndata(){\n          'selData': prop('array',{ \"default\":[{'name':'one','value':'on'},{'name':'two','value':'tw'}]}),\n          'selectedList': prop('array',{'default':['one','two']})\n  },\n  static methods() {\n    return{\n      remove: function(event,curr,ltSelected,comp,method,item){\n          for(var i=0;i < this.getData('dropData1').length;i++){\n              if(this.getData(\"dropData1\")[i].value==curr){\n                  var valueToRemove=this.getData('dropData1')[i].name;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n          arrayUtils( this.getData( 'selectedList' ), 'removeObjects', valueToRemove);\n      },\n      add: function(event,curr,ltSelected,comp,method,item){\n          for(var i=0;i < this.getData('dropData1').length;i++){\n              if(this.getData('dropData1')[i].value==curr){\n                  var valueToAdd=this.getData('dropData1')[i].name;\n                  break;\n              }\n          }\n          arrayUtils(this.getData('selectedList'),'push',valueToAdd);\n      }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the values provided in lt-prop-selected are selected by default in the multi-dropdown, but also user should make sure to render these default values in button to avoid conflict while selecting those values. These values also should have same keys as provided in lt-prop-user-value and lt-prop-system-value\nThe selData array is provided to lt-prop-selected and selectedList array is used in yield to render the values in lyte-drop-button.\n\nThe lyte-dropbox can also be yielded as example below. To yield lyte-dropbox make sure to provide lt-prop-data-yield value to true. Here, the text content inside the lyte-drop-item can only be yielded.\n\nTo yield the dropbox, ltPropData should also be provided by the user.\n\n```html\n<lyte-multi-dropdown lt-prop-data-yield=\"true\"  lt-prop-data=\"{{dropData}}\" lt-prop-type=\"checkbox\" lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\"   >\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"lytedropboxyield\">\n    <% if( dropItem.name == \"one\" ) { %>\n        {{dropItem.name}}\n    <% } %>\n\n    <% if( dropItem.name == \"two\" ) { %>\n        {{dropItem.name}}\n    <% } %>\n\n    <% if( dropItem.name == \"three\" ) { %>\n        {{dropItem.name}}\n    <% } %>\n    </template>\n</lyte-multi-dropdown >\n```\n\nIn the above example, 'dropItem' is given to user from the component and 'name' property is lt-prop-user-value set by the user.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

As you saw the example in the doc, starting the tour creates a dimmed overlay with some elements promoted above the overlay. It is the responsibility of the user to create these elements and promote them above the overlay. So on clicking the tour start, make sure you render these promoted elements.\n\nThe lyte-tour component is the outer component and holds all the hints of the tour. As we said before a hint is used to explain a particular feature.\n\nThe lyte-tour component mainly consists of 2 sub level components, each component has seperate properties and callbacks. So in total there are three components - the main component and the two sub level component.\n\nMain Tour\n\nThe \"lyte-tour\" is the main parent or wrapper component that, which comes only one time and holds all our hints inside it. Before calling the start tour function you have to do some steps.\n\nStep 1: Create a dummy div in your index.html file or your global html file, which will be holding all your dummy targets inside it.\n\nStep 2: Using CSS 'display' property or Lyte-if make your dummy div not available visually.\n\nStep 3: On starting your site tour make sure that you bring the dummy div into visual and then call the '.startLyteTour()' function.\n\n```html\n<lyte-tour class=\"yourTourClass\">\n  <!--  Inside this you will be having the lyte-tour-hint(s) -->\n</lyte-tour>\n```\n```html\n<div class=\"yourAppDummyTargets\">\n  <!--  Inside this you will be having your dummy hints -->\n</div>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n  return{\n    startTour : function(){\n    // Your code for getting your dummy targets inside the dom or visual.\n    $L( 'lyte-tour' )[0].component.startLyteTour()\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\nTour Hint\n\nThe \"lyte-tour-hint\" is the child of the main lyte-tour component. A hint is used to explain particular feature of the app and The explanation is divided into a set of steps. There can be any number of lyte-tour-hint(s) inside the lyte-tour component.\n\nStep 4: Inside your main dummy div create some 1st level wrapper div(s), these div will be your hints.\n\nStep 5: Like parent, hint div(s) must also be controlled with CSS 'display' property. And make sure that the first hint div alone is available visually and the remaining are hidden.\n\nStep 6: There is a property in lyte-tour-hint component which will take your hint-div's class name as the selector, which will help the tour component to navigate to the target Hint.\n\n```html\n<lyte-tour class=\"yourTourClass\">\n  <lyte-tour-hint lt-prop-selector=\".myHint1\">\n    <!--  Inside this you will be having the lyte-tour-step(s) -->\n  </lyte-tour-hint>\n</lyte-tour>\n```\n```html\n<div class=\"yourAppDummyTargets\">\n  <div class=\"myHint1\">\n    <!--  Inside this you will be having your dummy hints -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\nTour Step\n\nThe \"lyte-tour-step\" is the last level child of the lyte-tour component which comes inside lyte-tour-hint and cannot be given as a child to main lyte-tour component and there can be any number of lyte-tour-step inside the hints.\n\nStep 7: Inside the hint div create your dummy target element with the exact same position of the original target element that you need to explain.\n\nStep 8: Give a new class name for the dummy targets, so that it won't cause problem on taking a site tour. For eg: step1, step2, etc.\n\nStep 9: Lyte-tour-step component also has the same property name 'lt-prop-selector', where you will be giving all those dummy target's new class names, here step1, step2, etc.\n\nCustom elements: Lyte-tour-step takes yield inside it where you can give your own style and content to the tour steps.\n\nThere are two custom elements available in tour 'lyte-tour-next-button' and 'lyte-tour-prev-button' which can be helpful for the user to navigate back and forth between the steps.\n\n```html\n<lyte-tour class=\"yourTourClass\">\n  <lyte-tour-hint lt-prop-selector=\".myHint1\">\n    <lyte-tour-step lt-prop-selector=\".myStep1\">\n      <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"lyteTourStep\">\n        <!-- Here goes you contents part -->\n        <lyte-tour-next-button> Next </lyte-tour-next-button>\n        <lyte-tour-prev-button> Previous </lyte-tour-prev-button>\n      </template>\n    </lyte-tour-step>\n  </lyte-tour-hint>\n</lyte-tour>\n```\n```html\n<div class=\"yourAppDummyTargets\">\n  <div class=\"myHint1\">\n    <div class=\"myStep1\"> </div> <!--  This is your target div -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

You can set the name, value and id attribute for the input rendered inside the lyte-checkbox by making use of the lt-prop-name, lt-prop-value, and lt-prop-id attribute. If you want the checkbox to be checked when it is rendered, use the lt-prop-checked, attribute.

Set it to true to disable them.\n\n```html\n<lyte-checkbox lt-prop-disabled=\"true\" lt-prop-name='checkbox' lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-value='val' lt-prop-id=\"checkbox\" lt-prop-label=\"Check Box\">\n</lyte-checkbox>\n<lyte-checkbox lt-prop-disabled=\"true\" lt-prop-type=\"switch\" lt-prop-name='checkbox' lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-value='val' lt-prop-id=\"checkbox\" lt-prop-label=\"Check Box\">\n</lyte-checkbox>\n<lyte-checkbox lt-prop-disabled=\"true\" lt-prop-type=\"slider\" lt-prop-name='checkbox' lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-value='val' lt-prop-id=\"checkbox\" lt-prop-label=\"Check Box\">\n</lyte-checkbox>\n```\nNative Events Of Checkbox\n\nThe lyte-checkbox tag supports click, focus and blur functions. You can simply querySelect a lyte-checkbox from the DOM and call the necessary function. The click event changes the state of the checkbox, whereas the focus event can be used to focus it. After it has been focused, you can press spacebar or enter to change the state of the checkbox. Similarly, the blur event is used to remove focus from the checkbox.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-checkbox' ).click();\n```\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-checkbox' ).focus();\n```\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-checkbox' ).blur();\n```\nFoot Notes\n\nThe lyte-checkbox provides a number of callbacks for you to work with and do actions according to the change in state. The callbacks are on-changed, , on-checked, on-unchecked, on-before-checked, and on-before-unchecked. When the checkbox is checked, the order in which the callbacks are fired are on-before-checked > on-checked > on-changed . When the checkbox is unchecked, the order in which the callbacks are fired are on-before-unchecked > on-unchecked > on-changed . You can return false in either the on-before-checked or the on-before-unchecked to prevent the checkbox from changing state. By default, when a checkbox is checked on render, its callbacks are not fired. To fire these callbacks on render, set the lt-prop-fire-on-init to true .\n\n```html\n<lyte-checkbox on-before-unchecked={{method(\"preventUncheck\")}} lt-prop-name='checkbox' lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-value='val' lt-prop-id=\"checkbox\" lt-prop-label=\"Check Box\"></lyte-checkbox>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic methods () {\n    return{\n       preventUncheck : function () {\n        // do stuff\n       return false ;\n       }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can change the state of the checkbox through script by making use of the .ltProp() function. Changing the state of the checkbox through script causes callbacks to fire. When a checkbox is checked, then the on-before-checked , on-checked and on-changed callbacks are fired. When a checkbox is unchecked, then the on-before-unchecked , on-unchecked and on-changed callbacks are fired.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector ( 'lyte-checkbox' ).ltProp( 'checked' , true );\n```\n\nYou can get the state of the checkbox through script using the .ltProp() function.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector ( 'lyte-checkbox' ).ltProp( 'checked' );\n```\n\nYou can set a class to the label of the checkbox by setting the lt-prop-label-class .\n```html\n<lyte-checkbox lt-prop-label-class=\"checkbox-red\" lt-prop-name='checkbox' lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-value='val' lt-prop-id=\"checkbox\" lt-prop-label=\"Check Box\"></lyte-checkbox>\n```\n\nIt should be noted that the checkbox icon rendered in lyte-checkbox is derived from an svg file. This is attached to a span by using the background property. So you can create a custom checkbox by changing the background property of this span and appending your own svg icons. This is achieved using the lt-prop-class attribute which sets a class directly on the span.\n```html\n<lyte-checkbox lt-prop-class=\"checkbox-green\" lt-prop-name='checkbox' lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-value='val' lt-prop-id=\"checkbox\" lt-prop-label=\"Check Box\"></lyte-checkbox>\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

In the above example, the name key referenced by lt-prop-user-value contains the label of the checkbox and the value key referenced by lt-prop-system-value contains the unique value to identify each checkbox. These values are passed to the lt-prop-label and lt-prop-value properties of the lyte-checkbox rendered inside the group.\n\nAlignment\n\nYou can align the checkboxes either horizontally or vertically using the lt-prop-alignment property.\n\n```html\n<lyte-checkbox-group lt-prop-alignment=\"vertical\" lt-prop-options={{data}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\"></lyte-checkbox-group>\n```\nSelected Values\n\nTo get the selected values of the checkbox group, use the lt-prop-selected attribute. The lt-prop-selected will be an array of objects and these objects are nothing but the objects inside the lt-prop-options.\n\nSimilarly, to render a group with initial selected values pass an array of objects to the lt-prop-selected attribute.\n\n```html\n<lyte-checkbox-group lt-prop-selected={{selected}} lt-prop-options={{data}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\"></lyte-checkbox-group>\n```\n```javascript\ndata()\n{\n    prop(\"array\",{\n    default:[ {\n        'name': 'label 1',\n        'value': '1'\n    }, {\n        'name': 'label 2',\n        'value': '2'\n    }, {\n        'name': 'label 3',\n        'value': '3'\n    } ]\n    selected: [ {\n        'name': 'label 2',\n        'value': '2'\n    } ]\n})\n}\n```\n\nYou can get/set the selected array in javascript using the .ltProp() function.\n\n```javascript\n// Getter\nvar group = document.querySelector( 'lyte-checkbox-group' );\nvar selectedArray = group.ltProp( 'selected' );\n\n// Setter\n\ngroup.ltProp( 'selected', myNewArray );\n```\nYielded Group\n\nYou can also yield the lyte-checkbox-group using the lt-prop-yield attribute. The lt-prop-yield allows you to pass in your own label for each of the checkboxes rendered inside the group.\n\n```html\n<lyte-checkbox-group lt-prop-yield=\"true\" lt-prop-options={{data}} lt-prop-user-value=\"name\" lt-prop-system-value=\"value\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <b>{{lyteItem.name}}</b>\n    </template>\n</lyte-checkbox-group>\n```\n\nIn the above example, the content inside the yield will be used for every checkbox rendered inside the group.\n\nThe lyteItem variable that is used inside the yield is a variable which is passed to the yield from within the lyte-checkbox-group. It is nothing but the individual object in the lt-prop-options array.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

Similar to input[type='radio'] needing a name attribute, lyte-radiobuttons will need a lt-prop-name attribute to group similar radios together. Apart from this, each radio-button needs a unique lt-prop-value. You can set a label for the lyte-radiobutton using the lt-prop-label attribute. Pass the lt-prop-checked attribute to the radiobutton that needs to be checked at the start. Only one radiobutton can be checked at a time.\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-name=\"default\" lt-prop-value=\"1\" lt-prop-label=\"$1000 - $2000\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-name=\"default\" lt-prop-value=\"2\" lt-prop-label=\"$2000 - $5000\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-name=\"default\" lt-prop-value=\"3\" lt-prop-label=\"Above $5000\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\nPrimary Radio Button\nYou can render a primary radio button by setting the lt-prop-type attribute to primary.\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"primary\" lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-name=\"primary\" lt-prop-value=\"1\" lt-prop-label=\"IOS\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"primary\" lt-prop-name=\"primary\" lt-prop-value=\"2\" lt-prop-label=\"Android\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"primary\" lt-prop-name=\"primary\" lt-prop-value=\"3\" lt-prop-label=\"Windows\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\nSecondary Radio Button\nYou can render a secondary radio button by setting the lt-prop-type attribute to secondary.\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"secondary\" lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-name=\"secondary\" lt-prop-value=\"1\" lt-prop-label=\"Low\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"secondary\" lt-prop-name=\"secondary\" lt-prop-value=\"2\" lt-prop-label=\"Medium\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"secondary\" lt-prop-name=\"secondary\" lt-prop-value=\"3\" lt-prop-label=\"High></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\nSwitches\nYou can also render a radiobutton as a switch. Set the lt-prop-type attribute as switch.\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"switch\" lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-name=\"switch\" lt-prop-value=\"1\" lt-prop-label=\"Upper Channel\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"switch\" lt-prop-name=\"switch\" lt-prop-value=\"2\" lt-prop-label=\"Middle Channel\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"switch\" lt-prop-name=\"switch\" lt-prop-value=\"3\" lt-prop-label=\"Lower Channel\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\nSliders\nYou can also render a radiobutton as a slider. Set the lt-prop-type attribute as slider.\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"slider\" lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-name=\"slider\" lt-prop-value=\"1\" lt-prop-label=\"2x Slowdown\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"slider\" lt-prop-name=\"slider\" lt-prop-value=\"2\" lt-prop-label=\"4x Slowdown\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-type=\"slider\" lt-prop-name=\"slider\" lt-prop-value=\"3\" lt-prop-label=\"6x Slowdown\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\nNative Events Of Radiobutton\n\nThe lyte-radiobutton tag supports click, focus and blur functions. You can simply querySelect a lyte-radiobutton from the DOM and call the necessary function. The click event changes the state of the radiobutton but only when it is unchecked. It does not change the state when it is checked. Whereas the focus event can be used to focus it. After it has been focused, you can press spacebar or enter to change the state of the radiobutton. This works similar to the click event where the state of the radiobutton is changed only when it is unchecked. Similarly, the blur event is used to remove focus from the radiobutton.\n\n```html\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-radiobutton' ).click();\n```\n```html\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-radiobutton' ).focus();\n```\n```html\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-radiobutton' ).blur();\n```\nFoot Notes\n\nThe lyte-radiobutton provides a number of callbacks for you to work with when the state of a radiobutton changes. The callbacks are on-changed, on-before-checked, on-before-unchecked, on-checked, and on-unchecked. Initially when none of the radiobuttons are checked the order in which the callbacks are fired when the first radiobutton is checked is on-before-checked > on-checked > on-changed . When a radiobutton is already checked and a different radiobutton in the same group is checked, then the callback fire order is on-before-unchecked > on-before-checked > on-unchecked > on-checked > on-changed . When a radiobutton is checked on render, none of the callbacks are called by default. If you want to fire the callbacks at the start, then set lt-prop-fire-on-init to true .\n\nDevelopers should note that they must pass the callbacks to all the radiobuttons. The example below demonstrates a radiobutton with callbacks passed in.\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton on-changed={{method(\"changed\")}} lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-name=\"callback\" lt-prop-value=\"1\" lt-prop-label=\"Option 1\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton on-changed={{method(\"changed\")}} lt-prop-name=\"callback\" lt-prop-value=\"2\" lt-prop-label=\"Option 2\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic methods() {\n    return{\n       changed: function() {\n        // do stuff\n       }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou could return false from either the on-before-checked or on-before-unchecked callback to prevent the radio button from getting checked or unchecked.\n\nThe return false from one of the before callbacks feature is also available.\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton on-before-checked={{method(\"returnFalse\")}} lt-prop-checked=\"true\" lt-prop-name=\"callback\" lt-prop-value=\"1\" lt-prop-label=\"Option 1\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n<lyte-radiobutton on-before-checked={{method(\"returnFalse\")}} lt-prop-name=\"callback\" lt-prop-value=\"2\" lt-prop-label=\"Option 2\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic methods() {\n    return{\n        returnFalse: function() {\n        // do stuff\n        return false;\n       }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also change the state of the radiobutton through script by setting the lt-prop-checked attribute. When no radiobuttons are checked and you set lt-prop-checked to one of the radiobuttons then on-before-checked , on-checked and on-changed are fired. When a radiobutton is already checked and you check another radiobutton in the same group through script, then on-before-unchecked , on-before-checked , on-unchecked , on-checked and on-changed are fired. When you uncheck a radiobutton through script, then on-before-unchecked , on-unchecked and on-changed are fired.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-radiobutton' ).ltProp( 'checked' , true );\n```\n\nYou can get the state of the radio-button through script using the .ltProp() function.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-radiobutton' ).ltProp( 'checked' );\n```\n\nYou can set a class to the label of the radiobutton through the lt-prop-label-class .\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-label-class=\"radio-red\" lt-prop-name=\"label-example\" lt-prop-value=\"1\" lt-prop-label=\"Check Me\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\n\nSimilar to checkbox, the lyte-radiobutton has a span which is used to render the radio icon. You can customize the radiobutton icon by passing the lt-prop-class attribute and setting your own css to that class.\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-class=\"radio-green\" lt-prop-name=\"class-example\" lt-prop-value=\"1\" lt-prop-label=\"Check Me\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Radio Button Group\n\nLyte radiobutton group helps to group lyte-radiobutton component. This component is quite distinct from the regular radio- button as it allows you to collectively gather the selected data using the 'selected' property. This component also provides with the horizontal alignment with 'alignment' property.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- Individual component files -->\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-radiobutton.css\"> </link>\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-radiobutton-group.css\"> </link>\n\nalso requires a sprite file - node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/images/lyte_ui_sprite.svg - loaded automatically from CSS.\n```\nBasic\n\nThe lyte-radiobutton-group component is used to group the lyte-radiobutton component. Similar to input[type='radio'], lyte-radiobutton-group mandates to define the 'lt-prop-name' attribute and it can be rendered with an array, by simply passing the data to the 'lt-prop-options-attribute.' Have a look at the below code snippet to see how it is done.\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton-group lt-prop-name=\"OS\"\nlt-prop-options=\"{{options}}\"\nlt-prop-user-value=\"name\"\nlt-prop-system-value=\"value\">\n</lyte-radiobutton-group>\n```\n```javascript\n/* In your component */\ndata(){\n    return {\n        options : prop ( 'array' , { default : [ {\n                \"name\": \"IOS\",\n                \"value\": \"apple\"\n            }, {\n                \"name\": \"Android\",\n                \"value\": \"google\"\n            }, {\n                \"name\": \"Window\",\n                \"value\": \"mircosoft\"\n            } ]\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\nEach object in the array which is passed to the lt-prop-options should have the user-value and the system-value. In the above example the user-value is name and the system-value is value .\nThe system-value is the value given to the value attribute (lt-prop-value) of the lyte-radiobutton.\nThe user-value is the value given to the label attribute (lt-prop-label) of the lyte-radiobutton.\nThe lt-prop-system-value specifies the property name for the system-value in the object. In the above example, the value property access the value of each item.\nThe lt-prop-user-value specifies the property name for the user-value in the object. In the above example, the name property access the label of each item.\nType\nThe 'lt-prop-type' is used to render different types of radiobutton-group such us default, primary, secondary, switch and slider.\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton-group lt-prop-name=\"sports\"\nlt-prop-options=\"{{options}}\"\nlt-prop-user-value=\"name\"\nlt-prop-system-value=\"association\">\n</lyte-radiobutton-group>\n```\n```javascript\n/* In your component */\ndata() {\n    return {\n        options : prop ( 'array' , { default : [ {\n                \"name\": \"Football\",\n                \"association\": \"FIFA\"\n            }, {\n                \"name\": \"Cricket\",\n                \"association\": \"ICC\"\n            }, {\n                \"name\": \"Hockey\",\n                \"association\": \"FIH\"\n            } ]\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\nAlignment\n\nThe 'lt-prop-alignment' is used to align the lyte-radiobutton-group in horizontal or in vertical direction.\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton-group lt-prop-name=\"products\"\nlt-prop-options=\"{{options}}\"\nlt-prop-user-value=\"productName\"\nlt-prop-system-value=\"productCode\">\n</lyte-radiobutton-group>\n```\n```javascript\n/* In your component */\ndata() {\n    return {\n        options : prop ( 'array' , { default : [ {\n                \"productName\": \"CRM\",\n                \"productCode\": \"Z001\"\n            }, {\n                \"productName\": \"CREATORS\",\n                \"productCode\": \"Z012\"\n            }, {\n                \"productName\": \"BOOKS\",\n                \"productCode\": \"Z007\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"productName\": \"MAIL\",\n                \"productCode\": \"Z041\"\n            }]\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\nYielded Syntax\n\nThe 'lt-prop-yield' allows to yield the text label of the lyte-radiobutton. The content you provide in the yield replaces a text inside a span in the lyte-radiobutton. With the yield syntax, lt-prop-label is not required. The ltItem contains the value of each item given in lt-prop-options.\n\nNote : The ltItem value will be set by the lyte-radiobutton-group component from the 'lt-prop-options'. You no need to define ltItem in the your component's data.\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton-group\nlt-prop-direction=\"Vertical\"\nlt-prop-name=\"zohoProducts\"\nlt-prop-options=\"{{options}}\"\nlt-prop-system-value=\"productCode\"\nlt-prop-yield=true>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        {{ltItem.productName}}\n        <span class=\"{{ltItem.iconClass}}\">\n        </span>\n    </template>\n</lyte-radiobutton-group>\n```\n```javascript\n/* In your component */\ndata() {\n    return {\n        options : prop ( 'array' , { default : [ {\n                \"productName\": \"Cliq\",\n                \"iconClass\": \"cliq_icon\",\n                \"productCode\": \"Z001\"\n            }, {\n                \"productName\": \"connect\",\n                \"iconClass\": \"connect_icon\",\n                \"productCode\": \"Z002\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"productName\": \"MAIL\",\n                \"iconClass\": \"zmail_icon\",\n                \"productCode\": \"Z003\"\n            }]\n        })\n    }\n}\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Connect\n\nLyte Connect is a simple, yet powerful tool that helps you to build highly customizable component for creating flow charts.\n\nOn receiving the basic element, being in a rectangle shape, you can easily customize the CSS properties and change it into any desired shape as per your wish.\n\nConnectors like curve, line, elbow, advanced_curve, curvyLine are also supported in this component.\n\nLyte Connect component internally uses Lyte-connection plugin for creating connections.\n\nAs Lyte Connect is built on the top of Lyte framework, it is good to have a better understanding of the Lyte Framework.\n\nOn installing the dependencies, you can easily install Lyte Connect and start working with it.\n\n\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- ui-component css files -->\n\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/components/styles/lyte-ui-sortable.css\"></link>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/components/styles/lyte-ui-connect-item.css\"></link>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/components/styles/lyte-ui-connect.css\"></link>\n```\n\nThe anatomy of a connect element is as shown below.\n\nTags used\n\nThe following custom tags are used in Lyte Connect.\n\nlyte-connect-item\tIndividual element\nlyte-connect-header\tHeader part of connect item\nlyte-connect-footer\tFooter part of connect item\nlyte-connection-content\tScrollable element which contains all inner list\nlyte-suggestion-element\tSuggestion icon part of connect item\n\nData structure\n\nEach element's data should be defined in lt-prop-data ( Array ).\n\nLyte-connect component internally iterates this data and creates lyte-connect-item elements.\n\nContents of each individual element can be rendered through yield.\n\nAfter the initial render, elements should be rendered / removed through the utils provided by the connect component.\n\n\n\n```javascript\n{\n\n    fields: [ // It should be rendered inside lyte-connect-content( for handling lazy loading )\n        // repeated fields -  data for individual field item\n    ],\n    \"position\": { // Position data. Particular element will be rendered in given position. If its not provided it will be placed in random place.\n        \"left\": 40, // px value\n        \"top\": 40\n    },\n    \"id\": \"random_comment_1\", // will be set as id for lyte-connect-item. It should be unique\n    class : \"some_class\" // will be added as class to lyte-connect-item element\n}\n```\n```javascript\n{\n  id : \"random_group_id\",\n  position : {\n    left : 0,\n    top : 0\n  },\n  children : [\n    // same structure of individual element data\n  ]\n}\n```\nElbow example\n\nAn elbow connnector is made of series of connected lines. Generally they are termed as one way, two way, three way, ... N way connectors.\n\nGenerally Lyte Connect creates one, two, three, four, five way connectors and on enabling Line break it can go upto N ways.\n\nConnection arc is supported only in elbow connectors. When two connector lines orthogonal intersects, an arc gets created in horizontal line in overlapping point. And the arcs won't be created while dragging.\n\nConnection avoidance is supported only in elbow connectors. When two horizontal lines from different elements overlap, the new line position automatically moves to a different free position within the available space. Avoidance won't be checked while dragging\n\nLine marker is also supported in elbow connectors. If it is enabled, a marker element is created on the center point of the line. While dragging, line marker is not created. Marker element should be mentioned as array of points. ( In this example it is given as [ [ 0,-5 ], [ 10, 0 ], [ 0, 5 ] ] )\n\n\n\nFor rendering connection you need to specify src and target positions.( refer js sample ). If you don't have any positional details of shapes and connectors use Lyte-shape-wrap component.\n\n```html\n<lyte-connect lt-prop-data = {{elbowFields}} lt-prop-line-marker = '[[0,-5],[10,0],[0,5]]' lt-prop-elbow-arc = true lt-prop-avoid-line = true lt-prop-text-box = true lt-prop-undo = true lt-prop-arrange-type = \"siblingtree\" lt-prop-connection-type = \"elbow\" lt-prop-check-line-break = true lt-prop-selectors = '{\"selector\":\".lyteConnectAnchorPoint\",\"markerEnd\":\"url(#lyteConnectionTailMarker)\",\"markerStart\":\"url(#lyteConnectionHeadMarker)\"}' lt-prop-query = \"#elbow_preview\" lt-prop-render-connectors-in-preview = true lt-prop-animation-duration = \"0.4s\" lt-prop-reconnect-handling = true lt-prop-default-anchors = [] style = \"width: 100%;height: 1000px;border: 1px solid\" on-connect = \"{{method('connectCreate1')}}\" on-reconnect = \"{{method('reconnect1')}}\">\n\t  <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"connection\">\n\t      <lyte-text lt-prop-value = {{connection.text}}></lyte-text>\n\t  </template>\n\t  <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"preview\">\n\t      <lyte-text lt-prop-value = {{data.text}}></lyte-text>\n\t  </template>\n\t  <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"textbox\">\n\t      <%ltPropItem.text.forEach( function( item ){%>\n\t        <span class=\"lyteConnectInnerSpan {{item.class}}\" id = {{item.id}}>\n\t          <span class = 'lyteInnerText'>{{item.text}}</span>\n\t        </span>\n\t      <%})%>\n\t  </template>\n</lyte-connect>\n```\n```javascript\nelbowFields ==> [{\n        \"id\": \"state_0\",\n        \"text\": \"Start\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"id\": \"state_1562470000005128563\",\n        \"text\": \"signup\"\n    }, .....\n]\n\n\n\t// connection creation part\n\t[ {\n\t        \"options\": {\n\t            \"id\": \"id21\", // will be set to connector created\n\t            \"src_position\": {\n\t                \"x\": 0.5714285714285714, // in term of width of the shape\n\t                \"y\": 1 // in term of height of the shape\n\t            },\n\t            \"target_position\": {\n\t                \"x\": 0.5714285714285714,\n\t                \"y\": 0\n\t            }\n\t        },\n\t        \"src\": \"#state_0\", // src element selector\n\t        \"target\": \"#state_1562470000005128563\" // target element selector\n\t    },\n\t    .......\n\t].forEach( function( item ){\n\t\t$L('lyte-connect')[ 0 ].connect( item.src, item.target, item.options );\n\t});\n\n\n\n\tstatic methods() {\n\t  return{\n\t\tconnectCreate1 : function( src, target, connect, evt, pos ){\n\n\t\t\tvar evt_target = evt.target;\n\n\t\t\tif( !$L( evt_target ).hasClass( 'lyteConnectAnchorPoint' ) ){\n\t\t\t\treturn;\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tconnect.connect( '#' + src.parentNode.id, '#' + target.id, {\n\t\t\t\tid : \"connection\" + parseInt( Math.random() * 10000 ),\n\t\t\t\tsrc_position : pos,\n\t\t\t\ttarget_position : {\n\t\t\t\t\tx : parseFloat( evt_target.getAttribute( 'left' ) ),\n\t\t\t\t\ty : parseFloat( evt_target.getAttribute( 'top' ) )\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t},\n\n\t\treconnect1 : function(){\n\t\t\tvar evt = arguments[ 4 ];\n\n\t\t\treturn evt.target.closest( 'lyte-connect-item' );\n\t\t}\n          }\n\t}\n```\nCurve example\n\nThe connecting lines can also take the shape of a curve. While implementing the curves, line breaks, arc and line markers are not supported.\n\nBut you can render connector text box in this connector type.\n\nLyte Connect supports lazy loading for rendering each connect item's contents. Define your contents in fields key. You can use renderData key to iterate your contents. Each connect item data must be passed through the yield.\n\nWhen a connector's source or the target element is not rendered in DOM due to lazy loading or hidden during scroll, you can show alternate active source or target element. In such a case, provide a source or the target query like the below example.\n\n\n\n```html\n<lyte-connect lt-prop-query = \"#preview\" lt-prop-preview = true lt-prop-data = {{fields}} on-select = \"{{method('select')}}\" on-connect = \"{{method('connectCreate')}}\" on-reconnect = \"{{method('reconnect')}}\" lt-prop-select-mode = {{select}} lt-prop-group-arrange =

used\n\nThe following classes are used in this component.\n\nThese classes can be added and it can be customized as per your needs.\n\nBased on the source and target elements tagname different source and target classes will be added to the .lyteConnectionContainer connector element\n\n\n\nlyteConnectGroupShape\tIt will be added for group shape\nlyteConnectInnerItem\tIt will be added for all the children of a group shape\nlyteConnectionSelected\tIt will be added when an element is selected to drag\nlyteShapeHover\tIt will be added to an element and its all the src/target/connector elements when that element is hovered\nlyteConnectionHover\tIt will be added to an element and its all the src/target/connector elements when a particular connector element is hovered\nlyteConnectionSrcElement\tIt will be added to all the connector source elements\nlyteConnectionTargetElement\tIt will be added to all the connector target elements\nlyteConnectSelection\tThis class will be added when an element is selected by click\nlyteDragSelection\tThis will be added to lyte-connect element when mouse is down for entire area drag\nlyteClickSelection\tThis will be added to lyte-connect element when mouse is down for click and drag selection\nlyteConnectSelectionElement\tThis class will be added to div element created for selecting shapes in select mode\nlyteConnectContextualLevel<zoom_level>\tThis class will be added to the lyte-connect element based on the contextual zoom level\nlyteContextualAnimation\tThis class will be added before performing contextual zoom animation. You can define all kind of transition properties in this class\nlyteTextboxHover\tThis will be added to shapes and connector when its textbox got focused\nlyteConnectionCreateMousedown\tThis will be added to the lyte-connect element when a new connector is created through mouse actions\nlyteConnectorReconnect\tThis will be added to the lyte-connect element when a connector is dragged for reconnection in lt-prop-reconnection-handling\nlyteElementSuggestedDisplay\tThis will be added to the lyte-suggestion-element when the suggestion is possible\nlyteElementSuggestedHover\tThis will be added to the lyte-suggestion-element when it is hovered\nlyteConnectSuggestedItem\tThis will be added to the lyte-connect-item element when it is created by suggestion, while hovering\nUndo\n\nLyte-connect supports undo and redo operations. To enable this provide lt-prop-undo as true to lyte-connect element.\n\nShape creation, delete, connection creation, delete, textBox creation, delete, adding, removing textbox values, shape movement, contextual zoom are supported in undo and redo.\n\nYou can also push your custom undo, redo operations in lyte-connect component. In this case while calling undo and redo operation onCustomUndo method gets called. You can perform your custom operations inside this.\n\nUndo value should be a strigified array / object.\n\n```javascript\n$L( 'lyte-connect' ).get( 0 ).pushToQueue({\n\ttype : \"custom\",\n\tsub_type : \"insert_anchor\",\n\tvalue : JSON.stringify({\n\t\tindex : 1,\n\t\tmain_index : 1,\n\t\tpt : {\n\t\t\tx : 0,\n\t\t\ty : 0.5\n\t\t},\n\t\tid : 'shape_id'\n\t})\n})\n```\nContextual zoom\n\nAlthough scale zooming is supported in connect element it is recommended to use contextual zoom.\n\nWhenever user wants to see all the available shapes and connectors in the single page it is hard to read the contents of the shapes in lower scale levels.\n\nInstead of scaling, you can go with contextual zoom. based on the zoom level different classes and --contextualLevel css variable will be updated. You can modify font size, width, height properties based on the css classes and variable. You can also hide unnescessary elements in lower zoom levels. Modifications in left, top values should be defined in contextual zoom data. You can even hide connectors in lower zoom levels\n\nDefault contextual zoom value is 100( which is equivalent to scale 1 );\n\nMagnetiser\n\nTo avoid shape overlaps, magnetiser is used.With magnitiser, on moving a shape, all the other nearby shapes gets adjusted based on the current moving shape's position.\n\n\n\n```javascript\n<lyte-connect lt-prop-magnetiser = true lt-prop-data = {{elbowFieldsCopy}} lt-prop-avoid-line = true lt-prop-arrange-type = \"siblingtree\" lt-prop-connection-type = \"elbow\" lt-prop-check-line-break = true lt-prop-selectors = '{\"selector\":\".lyteConnectAnchorPoint\",\"markerEnd\":\"url(#lyteConnectionTailMarker)\",\"markerStart\":\"url(#lyteConnectionHeadMarker)\"}' lt-prop-preview = false lt-prop-default-anchors = [] style = \"width: 100%;height: 1000px;border: 1px solid\">\n                       <template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"connection\">\n                           <lyte-text lt-prop-value = {{connection.text}}></lyte-text>\n                       </template>\n                   </lyte-connect>\n```\nGroup arrange\n\nYou can render connect items inside a connect items. This is termed as group shape. You cannot drag child element alone.\n\nWhen group arrange property is enabled you can reposition group items, add and remove elements in group. You can also create new groups\n\n```html\n<lyte-connect lt-prop-data = {{groupfields}} lt-prop-preview = false lt-prop-connection-type = \"advanced_curve\" lt-prop-contextual-zoom = false

    "content": "Connection\n\nLyte-connection is a plugin used to create connections between two dom elements.\n\nConnection lines can be elbow, curved and straight lines. These are created in svg elements.\n\nYou can define suitable marker elements for lines created inside svg element. You need to render a svg element inside your element. Connection lines are created inside in this svg element.\n\nWhenever your element dimension and position are changed you can call update util for refreshing the connectors.\n\nSource and target position of a connector element will be based on src_position and target_position( { y : 0.5, x : 1 } ). x times of width and y times of height will be used for positioning.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- common ui-component files -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-dom/lyte-dom.js\"></script>;\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/plugins/connect/lyte-connection.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/plugins/connect/lyte-connection.elbow.js\"></script> // for elbow connections\n```\nAnatomy\n\nThe anatomy of a connection is as shown below.\n\nCss used\n\nAdd the following css while using the connection plugin\n\n```css\n.lyteConnectionPath{\n\tstroke: blue;\n\tstroke-width: 2;\n\tfill: none;\n}\n\n.lyteConnectionFakePath{\n\tstroke: transparent;\n\tstroke-width:5;\n\tfill: none;\n}\n\n.lyteConnectionFakeContainer, .lyteConnectionContainer{\n\tpointer-events: none;\n\t/*will-change: transform;*/\n}\n\n.lyteConnectionContainer path{\n\tpointer-events: auto;\n\t/*will-change: d*/\n}\n\n.connectionExampleMarker {\n\tpointer-events: none;\n\twidth: 100%;\n\theight: 100%;\n\tposition: absolute;\n\tleft: 0;\n\ttop: 0;\n}\n```\nElbow connections\n\nThis will create elbow connections between provided source and target elements. You can provide elbow corner radius for the connectors.\n\nAlso you can provide modifier values for elbow connectors. Generally for a 3 way elbow connector mid line will pass through mid point of width / height based on the start position. by passing modifier you can define the mid line position in 3 way connector. it will be px value from start point of the connector\n\n```javascript\nvar $node = $L( '.exampleElbow', this.$node ).connection({\n\twrapperElement : $L( this.$node ).find( '.exampleElbow .connectionExampleMarker' ).get( 0 ), // svg element inside wrapper. here all the connections will be created\n\tconnector_radius : 0,\n\tconnection_type : \"elbow\",\n\tmarkerEnd : \"url(#lyteConnectionTailMarker)\", // will be set for all the connections created\n\tmarkerStart : \"url(#lyteConnectionHeadMarker)\"\n});\n\n[ [ \"#pk1\", \"#pk2\" ], [ \"#pk1\", \"#pk3\" ], [ \"#pk2\", \"#pk4\" ], [ \"#pk4\", \"#pk5\" ], [ \"#pk4\", \"#pk6\" ], [ \"#pk2\", \"#dummy\", 33 ] ].forEach( function( item ){\n\t$node.connection( 'create', item[ 0 ], item[ 1 ], {\n\t\tid : \"connection\" + parseInt( Math.random() * 10000 ),\n\t\t// for rtl give src position as target and target as src\n\t\tsrc_position : {\n\t\t\ty : 0.5,\n\t\t\tx : 1\n\t\t},\n\t\ttarget_position : {\n\t\t\ty : 0.5,\n\t\t\tx : 0\n\t\t},\n\t\tmodifiers : item[ 2 ] ?

  "https://slyte.csez.zohocorpin.com/1.0.0/uiComponents/plugins/overview": {
    "order": 140,
    "content": "Plugins\n\nPlugins are set of javascript libraries which impart behaviour to your components. While lyte-ui-components are a set of components which create visual elements on the screen, plugins impart behaviour to these visual elements. Behaviours can be sortable, draggable, droppable, etc.\n\nGetting Started\n\nTo use plugins in your app, all you need is the lyte-ui-components and the lyte-dom package. Open the package.json file in your app and add lyte-ui-components as a dependency as follows.\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"name\": \"my-app\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"description\": \"Description for my-app goes here\",\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"license\": \"ISC\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"@zoho/lyte-dom\": \"2.0.23\",\n        \"@zoho/lyte-ui-component\": \"4.0.0\"\n    },\n    \"devDependencies\": {},\n    \"addons\": [\n        \"slyte-ui-component\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nOnce done, fire up the terminal and run the following command in same directory as your package.json.\n\n```javascript\nnpm install --registry http://cm-npmregistry\n```\n\nThis will install the lyte-ui-components and the lyte-dom package in your node_modules/@zoho/ folder. Now inside the node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-components folder, there is a plugins folder available. This contains all the plugins that you might need.\n\nTo import a plugin, simply add the path to the particular plugin in your index.html(or wherever you want to load it)\n\n```html\n<!-- Importing files -->\nimport \"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/plugins/lyte-requestqueue.js\"\n```\n\nThe above snippet will register the requestqueue plugin into your app.\n\nThe plugins are written on top of lyte-dom which is registered globally. So to use request queue you would use $L.requestQueue(...)\n\nPlugins are also available as a separate package from lyte-ui-components. To install plugins without lyte-ui-components, follow the below steps\n\nOpen package.json of your app and add the following dependencies\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"name\": \"my-app\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"description\": \"Description for my-app goes here\",\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"license\": \"ISC\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"@zoho/lyte-dom\": \"2.0.23\",\n        \"@zoho/lyte-ui-plugins\": \"2.0.0-beta-5\"\n    },\n    \"devDependencies\": {},\n    \"addons\": [\n        \"lyte-ui-plugins\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nAfter you are done, run the following command in the terminal\n\n```html\nnpm install --registry http://cm-npmregistry\n```\n\nOnce done, open the node_modules/@zoho folder that was created. Inside it you will find the lyte-ui-plugins package and inside the package there is a plugins folder which hosts the plugins that you want. You can then import the plugins into your app to use them.\n\n```html\n<!-- lyte dom is required -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-dom/lyte-dom.js></script>\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-plugins/plugins/lyte-requestqueue.js></script>\n```\nUsage\n\nOnce you have imported the plugins into your app, their use is pretty straightforward. For example, to make an element with id something draggable, all you have to do is invoke the following snippet.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"something\"></div>\n\n\n<script>\n    $L( '#something' ).draggable();\n</script>\n```\n\nInvoking the snippet inside the script tag makes the div with id something draggable. The $L() is the lyte-dom library and most plugins are written on top of it(except for a few).\n\nApart from this, plugins can take in configuration as well. Usually, the configuration is passed in as an object when invoking the plugin. The object can be used to modify the behaviour of the plugin, pass callbacks, etc.\n\n```javascript\n$L.lazyload({\n    container : '#container3',\n    selector : '.modalLazy',\n    onEnter : function( element ){\n        console.log(\"ENTERED\", element.getAttribute(\"alt\"));\n    },\n    onExit : function( element ){\n        console.log(\"EXITED\", element.getAttribute(\"alt\"));\n    },\n    onCancel : function( element ){\n        console.log(\"CANCEL\", element.getAttribute(\"alt\"));\n    },\n    onLoading : function( element ){\n        console.log(\"LOADING\", element.getAttribute(\"alt\"));\n    },\n    afterLoading : function( element ){\n        console.log(\"LOADED\", element.getAttribute(\"alt\"));\n    },\n    onError : function( element ){\n        console.log(\"ERROR\", element.getAttribute(\"alt\"));\n    },\n    onComplete : function( element ){\n        console.log(\"COMPLETE\", element.getAttribute(\"alt\"));\n    }\n});\n```\n\nSometimes plugins need to be destroyed as well. Plugins are destroyed when their associated visual elements are removed from the DOM. When a plugin is not destroyed, some of the DOM it holds onto lingers in the memory leading to increased memory usage(detached DOM). This isn't true for all plugins and it would be better to read the docs of the individual plugin to understand which plugins need to be destroyed.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#selector\").draggable( \"destory\" );\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "FocusStack\n\nFocus stack is used to establish relationship between two elements on the Dom tree which are not related locally(that is one does not follow the other). Relationship established by focus stack is the tab focusing order of two unrelated elements(focusing element 2 after tab is pressed when element 1 is focussed).\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- Individual plugin files -->\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/plugins/lyte-focusStack.js\"> </script>\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-dom/lyte-dom.js\"> </script>\n ---or----\n<!-- Importing files -->\nimport \"@zoho/lyte-ui-plugins/plugins/lyte-focusStack.js\"\nimport $L from \"@zoho/lyte-dom\";\n```\n\nCall this plugin only once as it is common to the entire dom, and callbacks can be included in the object which is given as argument to the plugin provided lyte-is-callback property in the element.\n\n```javascript\n$L.focusStack({\n    onBeforeChange : function ( ) {\n        console.log ( 'before change' )\n    }\n});\n```\nDefault focusStack\n\nThe focus stack attempts to build a linked list(singly/doubly depending on whether lyte-nfocus-name or lyte-bfocus-name) is passed. Not all elements in the DOM tree are part of the linked list. Only specific elements which has above mentioned attributes are included in the focus stack. The last element in the linked list is synchronized with the next element in the DOM tree to be focused. This means that when the tab key is pressed on last element of linked list, the focus automatically shifts to the local next element in the DOM tree. And the first element in this linked list will be focused after a tab is pressed on the local dom tree element before head of the linked list. When the tab key is pressed on the last element locally near the head of the linked list, the first element in the linked list becomes the focused element.\n\nHere you need to pass lyte-focus-name, lyte-bfocus-name and lyte-nfocus-name keys.\n\nlyte-focus-name This is used to uniquely identify the element on the linked list\nlyte-bfocus-name This represents the lyte-focus-name of the previous node in the linked list to connect to. So pressing shift tab will change focus from current node to this previous node.\nlyte-nfocus-name This represents the lyte-focus-name of the next node in the linked list to connect to. So pressing tab will change focus from current node to this next node.\n\n\n```html\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp1\" lyte-nfocus-name=\"inp4\" ></input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp2\" lyte-bfocus-name=\"inp1\" lyte-nfocus-name=\"inp3\" ></input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp3\" lyte-bfocus-name=\"inp2\" lyte-nfocus-name=\"inp4\" ></input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp4\" lyte-bfocus-name=\"inp3\" ></input>\n```\n```javascript\n$L.focusStack();\n```\nFocusStack with data-tabindex\n\nThe focus stack plugin can also be used to create several linked lists for multiple group of elements. It can be done by using data-tabindex attribute.\nThe values should be given in the format \"groupX-Y\"\nXindicates to which linked list is the element associated and Y indicates the index of the element in the linked list.\nIn a group, if there is no next element, then focus will be done based on default browser dom order, otherwise the element in next index in that group will be focused.\n\nUsing same values for data-tabindex in dom for different groups can be avoided. Duplicate values for lyte-focus-name and data-tabindex can lead to unwanted behaviour of the plugin.\n\n```html\n<input data-tabindex=\"group0-0\"><input>\n<input data-tabindex=\"group0-1\" ><input>\n<input data-tabindex=\"group0-2\" ><input>\n<input data-tabindex=\"group0-3\" ><input>\n\n<input data-tabindex=\"group1-0\"><input>\n<input data-tabindex=\"group1-2\" ><input>\n<input data-tabindex=\"group1-1\" ><input>\n<input data-tabindex=\"group1-3\" ><input>\n```\n```javascript\n$L.focusStack();\n```\n\nIf an index value in between a sequence of numbers is not provided, then focus will shift to the next local dom order element.\nIn the above eg, consider the element with data-tabindex value of group0-2 is missing and when the tab key is pressed from element group0-1, focus will shift to next local dom order element (i.e) group0-3 in this case.\n\nFocusStack with lyte-focus-name and tabindex\n\nIf we use both lyte-focus-name and data-tabindex attributes, then the first preference will be given to lyte-focus-name attributes, if none of lyte-bfocus-name or lyte-nfocus-name is found, then element in data-tabindex is focused.\nIf none of those attributes are provided then default browser action is done.\n\n```html\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp1\" lyte-nfocus-name=\"inp3\" data-tabindex=\"group0-0\"> </input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp2\" lyte-nfocus-name=\"inp4\" data-tabindex=\"group0-1\"  > </input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp3\"  data-tabindex=\"group0-2\"> </input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp4\"  > </input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp5\"  data-tabindex=\"group0-3\"> </input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp6\"  data-tabindex=\"group0-4\"> </input>\n```\n```javascript\n$L.focusStack();\n```\n\nTabbing from elements with lyte-focus-name will always try to use the lyte-nfocus-name or lyte-bfocus-name. In case these attributes not not available data-tabindex will be considered.\n\n\nFocusStack with lyte-focus-after\n\nTo make use of this property, provide ltPropChangeFocus value to true in the object parameter while calling the plugin. This property can be used when a user want to change focus to a particular element at the end of a group, but unsure of number of group elements.\n\n```html\n<input lyte-focus-after=\"1\">  </input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp1\"  data-tabindex=\"group1-0\"> </input>\n<input lyte-focus-name=\"inp2\"  data-tabindex=\"group1-1\"  > </input>\n```\n```javascript\n$L.focusStack({ltPropChangeFocus : 'true'});\n```\n\nIn the above example, we can see that after we press tab on the last element in the group, focus is shifted to the input element with lyte-focus-after=\"1\" attribute. Here, 1 represent group 1 and the property can have comma seperated values of multiple groups. For eg.lyte-focus-after=\"1,4,6\"\n\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "MentionsInput\n\nA plugin that let's you mention people in a textarea like you do on Facebook or Twitter. It pops-up a dropdown list containing suggestions while you start typing some alphabet followed by an ' @ ' in the textarea.\nIt can be used with both html textarea as well as lyte-input textarea.\nThe objects in the array provided as data to the plugin on calling onDataRequest should have the following structure :\n\n```javascript\n{\n    'id' : 1 ,\n    'name' : 'Samrat' ,\n    'avatar' : '../images/someImage.jpg' ,\n    'type' : 'contact'\n}\n```\n\n\"avatar\" property is a URL used for image avatars when \"avatars\"-option is enabled.\n\"id\" and the key name provided in searchBy property are the mandatory properties that should be present in the objects. For example, the searchBy property specifies \"name\" as the default value. Hence users are expected to have \"id\" and \"name\" properties in their objects. While filtering the data returned from onDataRequest method, their \"name\" property values will be checked against the query(user given input).\n\nTo destroy the mentions-input behaviour of the textarea, call the mentionsInput method with \"destroy\" as the arguement passed to the method.\n\neg:  \n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#selector\").mentionsInput( \"destory\" );\nOR\n$L(\".selector\").mentionsInput( \"destory\" );\n```\nDependencies\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-mentionsinput.css\"> </link>\n\n<!-- Individual plugin file -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/plugins/lyte-mentionsInput.js\"> </script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-dom/lyte-dom.js\"> </script>\n\n          ---or----\n<!-- Importing files -->\nimport \"@zoho/lyte-ui-plugins/plugins/lyte-mentionsInput.js\"\nimport $L from \"@zoho/lyte-dom\";\n```\nBasic example\n\nIn this example, data is passed as an array of objects. The objects matching the query will be shown in the list.\n\n```html\n<lyte-input id = \"selector1\" lt-prop-placeholder = \"Try to mention by typing @l\" lt-prop-direction = 'vertical' lt-prop-type = \"textarea\"> </lyte-input>\n<textarea class = \"selector2\" placeholder = \"Try to mention by typing @l\"> </textarea>\n```\n```javascript\n$L('#selector1').mentionsInput({\n    onDataRequest : function( query ){\n        // return some data\n    }\n});\n$L ('.selector2').mentionsInput({\n    onDataRequest : function( query ){\n        // return some data\n    }\n});\n```\nonDataRequest\n\nThis method is used by the users to return the data that will be used to construct the dropdown list. This list will be having the users whose property value mentioned by searchBy attribute matches the query. The query is passed to this method as an arguement. This data can be returned in 2 ways -\n\nas plain data i.e., array of objects\nas promise object, which returns array of objects on being resolved .\n\n\nAs Plain Data\n\nA simple array of objects is returned as data.

When pattern is not provided moment itself construct suitable pattern( additional-moment.js ).\n\nYou can convert a valid moment object into any suitable formats using format() . Default format will be YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ . You can also use already available standard formats / your custom format\n\n```javascript\n$L.moment( string, format )\n$L.moment( '28/04/1996', 'DD/MM/YYYY' ).format() // output will be \"1996-04-28T00:00:00+05:30\"\n$L.moment( '28/04/1996', 'DD/MM/YYYY' ).format( 'localMillisecondDatetime' ) // output will be \"1996-04-28T00:00:00.000\"\n$L.moment( '28.04.1996', 'DD.MM.YYYY' ).format( \"MM-DD-YYYY\" ) // output will be Corresponding date for MM.DD.YYYY is 04-28-1996\n```\nSupported time zones ( from 3.20.0 )\n\nYou can change the timezone after moment instace creation.\nTimezone can also be configured globally by $L.moment.setTimezone( timezoneName ) function.\nMoment internally uses toLocaleString api provided by the date object for converting timezone. It is not supported in IE browser( Timezone convertions in IE browser won't be accurate ).\n\nOutput of the toLocaleString depends on the browser. Some newly added timezones and modified DST timings won't work in old browsers.\n\n```javascript\n/* Converting to utc format */\n$L.moment( '28/04/1996', 'DD/MM/YYYY' ).utc().format(); // \"1996-04-27T18:30:00+00:00\"\n\n/* Converting to default format*/\n$L.moment( '28/04/1996', 'DD/MM/YYYY' ).local().format() // \"1996-04-28T00:00:00+05:30\"\n\n/* Converting to random format - This will read the string in local format then it will convert the time to given timezone */\n$L.moment( '28/04/1996', 'DD/MM/YYYY' ).timezone( \"Australia/Victoria\" ).format(); // \"1996-04-28T04:30:00+10:00\"\n\n/* To read a string in particular timezone - This will read the string in given timezone*/\n$L.moment( '28/04/1996', 'DD/MM/YYYY', { timezone : \"Australia/Victoria\" } ).format(); // \"1996-04-28T00:00:00+10:00\"\n\n/* To set the timezone globally - It will be applied to all the moment instances created*/\n$L.moment.setTimezone( \"Australia/Victoria\" );\n$L.moment( '28/04/1996', 'DD/MM/YYYY' ).format(); // \"1996-04-28T00:00:00+10:00\"\n\n/*Ignoring global timezone for a particular instance*/\n$L.moment.setTimezone( \"Australia/Victoria\" );\n$L.moment( '28/04/1996', 'DD/MM/YYYY', { ignore_timezone : true } ).format(); // \"1996-04-28T00:00:00+05:30\"\n```\nDifference between two dates\n\nYou can find the difference between two dates using fromNow utility. Output data will be like this. Default and accurate conversion values used in lyte-moment are given below\n\nNo.\tProperty\tDefault\tAccurate\n1\tyears\t320 * 24 * 60 * 60\t365 * 24 * 60 * 60\n2\tmonths\t26 * 24 * 60 * 60\t30 * 24 * 60 * 60\n3\tdays\t22 * 60 * 60\t24 * 60 * 60\n4\thours\t45 * 60\t60 * 60\n5\tminutes\t44\t60\n6\tseconds\t0\t1\n```javascript\n$L.moment( '28-04-1996', 'DD-MM-YYYY' ).fromNow( $L.moment( \"2021-07-12T20:51:49+05:30\", true ) );  // second argument is to indicate accurate conversion\n\n// output format\n{\npast:false, // To indicate the given date is past / future\ntimestamp:795473509000, // total timestamp difference\nseconds:{\n  value:49\n},\nminutes:{\n  value:51\n},\nhours:{\n  value:20\n},\ndays:{\n  value:21\n},\nmonths:{\n  value:2\n},\nyears:{\n  value:25\n},\nproperty:\"years\", // Maximum property name\nvalue:25 // maximum property value\n}\n```\nI18n conversion\n\nMoment can read and convert the date from other languages. By default it will use ui-component's default i18n conversion. You can change the converted value by returning new value in i18n callback.\n\n```javascript\n// To convert a date to other languages\n\ncallback_function = function( value, converted, format ){\n  return converted;\n}\n\n$L.moment('28/04/1996','DD/MM/YYYY').i18N( \"DD-MMM-YY\", callback_function );\n\n// To read an i18ned date string\n\ncallback_function = function( str, value, i18ned ){\nreturn convert argument 'value' to i18n; // returned value will be used for replacement check.\n}\n\n$L.moment( i18ned date,'DD-MMM-YY', { i18n : true, i18n_callback : callback_function })\n\n'callback_function' is optional\n\n// To convert Numbers to other languages - both will work\n$L.moment('28/04/1996','DD/MM/YYYY').i18N( \"DD-MMM-YY\", callback_function, true );\n$L.moment('28/04/1996','DD/MM/YYYY').i18N( \"DD-MMM-YY\", true );\n\n// To read i18ned Numbers\n$L.moment( i18ned date,'DD-MMM-YY', { i18n : true, number_conversion : true });\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

He is among the commanders who won and ended the Napoleonic Wars when the Seventh Coalition defeated Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.\n\n\tWellesley was born in Dublin into the Protestant Ascendancy in Ireland. He was commissioned as an ensign in the British Army in 1787, serving in Ireland as aide-de-camp to two successive lords lieutenant of Ireland. He was also elected as a member of Parliament in the Irish House of Commons. He was a colonel by 1796 and saw action in the Netherlands and in India, where he fought in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War at the Battle of Seringapatam. He was appointed governor of Seringapatam and Mysore in 1799 and, as a newly appointed major-general, won a decisive victory over the Maratha Confederacy at the Battle of Assaye in 1803.\n\n\tWellesley rose to prominence as a general during the Peninsular campaign of the Napoleonic Wars, and was promoted to the rank of field marshal after leading the allied forces to victory against the French Empire at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813. Following Napoleon's exile in 1814, he served as the ambassador to France and was made Duke of Wellington. During the Hundred Days in 1815, he commanded the allied army which, together with a Prussian Army under Field Marshal Gebhard von Blücher, defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. Wellington's battle record is exemplary; he ultimately participated in some 60 battles during the course of his military career.\n\n\tWellington is famous for his adaptive defensive style of warfare, resulting in several victories against numerically superior forces while minimising his own losses. He is regarded as one of the greatest defensive commanders of all time, and many of his tactics and battle plans are still studied in military academies around the world. After the end of his active military career, he returned to politics. He was twice British prime minister as a member of the Tory party from 1828 to 1830 and for a little less than a month in 1834. He oversaw the passage of the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, while he opposed the Reform Act 1832. He continued as one of the leading figures in the House of Lords until his retirement and remained Commander-in-Chief of the British Army until his death.`\n});\n```\nQr with custom images\n\nYou can hide part of a QR code with custom Logos or text. With the help of error correction still we can read the actual contents in the qr code.\n\nAlways use higer error correction modes( H or Q) in this case\n\nGenerate\n```javascript\nvar canvas = <Your canvas element>,\nimage = new Image();\n$L.qr({\n\tcanvas : canvas,\n\terror_correction : \"H\", // higher error correction mode\n\ttext : encodeURI( \"https://lyte.csez.zohocorpin.com/3.80.0/uiComponents/introduction\" )\n});\n\nimage.onload = function(){\n\tvar image_width = this.width,\n\timage_height = this.height,\n\tcanvas_width = canvas.width,\n\tcanvas_height = canvas.height,\n\tctx = canvas.getContext( \"2d\" ),\n\tx = ( canvas_width - image_width ) / 2,\n\ty = ( canvas_height - image_height ) / 2,\n\tradius = image_width / 2 + 30;\n\n\t// clearing the circular area\n\n\tctx.fillStyle = \"white\";\n\tctx.arc( canvas_width / 2, canvas_height / 2, radius, 0, 2 * Math.PI );\n\tctx.fill();\n\n\tctx.save();\n\n\t// placing text\n\n\tctx.fillStyle = \"black\";\n\tctx.font = '700 28px / 43px PuviRegular, sans-serif';\n\tctx.fillText( \"Lyte QR\", x + 20, canvas_height / 2 + radius - 35 );\n\tctx.save();\n\n\t// drawing the image in canvas\n\n\tctx.drawImage( this, 0, 0, image_width, image_height, x, y - 20, image_width, image_height );\n\n};\nimage.src = \"/images/lyte.png\";\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

The callbacks for each request can be executed sequential or the callback of the first request to complete can also be executed. The request queue uses lyte-dom underneath and takes in all the properties of lyte-dom's ajax. The following example demonstrates making multiple requests with request queue.\n\n```javascript\n/* Create a request queue */\nvar queue = $L.reqQueue();\n\n/* Add a request inside it */\nqueue.add( [ {\n    url: '/comments',\n    success: function() {\n        /* Executed first */\n        /* process data */\n    }\n}, {\n    url: '/profile',\n    success: function() {\n        /* Executed second */\n        /* process data */\n    }\n} ] );\n\n/* Initiate the request */\nqueue.initiate();\n```\n\nIn the above example, we created a new request queue and added two requests into the queue. The requests are passed in as an array of objects. Note that the format of each of object is similar to the objects we pass to the $L.ajax function. Each of the objects in the array follow the same API as that of the $L.ajax function. The .initiate() will make the request and success callbacks of the corresponding requests are ran sequentially.\n\nEach of the objects passed to the .add() follows the same format as $L.ajax's API.\n\nBatching All Requests Together\n\nLyte-requestqueue provides callbacks when the requests are completed as well. The .initiate() function returns a callback which resolves when all the requests are successful and fails when atleast one request fails. The example below demonstrates it.\n\n```javascript\n/* Create a request queue */\nvar queue = $L.reqQueue();\n\n/* Add a request inside it */\nqueue.add( [ {\n    url: '/comments',\n    success: function() {\n        /* Executed first */\n        /* process data */\n    }\n}, {\n    url: '/profile',\n    success: function() {\n        /* Executed second */\n        /* process data */\n    }\n} ] );\n\n/* Initiate the request */\nvar prom = queue.initiate();\n\n/* Handle promise */\nprom.then( function ( res ) {\n    /* Resolves when every request is successful */\n    /* res contains information about the requests that succeeded */\n}, function( res ) {\n    /* Rejects when some of the requests reject */\n    /* res contains information about the requests that succeeded and failed */\n} );\n```\n\nIn the above example, the promise's .then() function can be leveraged to handle cases when all the requests are resolved and when atleast one of them fail.\n\nNon Sequential Requests\n\nAll the requests that we've seen till now have been executed sequentially, that is the order in which they were pushed in the queue. If you want to execute a request as soon as it resolves, then you set the sequential flag to false when creating the request queue.\n\n```javascript\n/* Create a request queue with sequential false */\nvar queue = $L.reqQueue( { sequential: false } );\n\n/* Add a request inside it */\nqueue.add( [ {\n    url: '/comments',\n    success: function() {\n        /* Executed as soon as it completes */\n        /* process data */\n    }\n}, {\n    url: '/profile',\n    success: function() {\n        /* Executed as soon as it completes */\n        /* process data */\n    }\n} ] );\n\n/* Initiate the request */\nvar prom = queue.initiate();\n\n/* Handle promise */\nprom.then( function( res ) {\n    /* Resolves when every request is successful */\n    /* res contains information about the requests that succeeded */\n}, function( res ) {\n    /* Rejects when some of the requests reject */\n    /* res contains information about the requests that succeeded and failed */\n} );\n```\nPromises\n\nRequest queue is no longer limited to using only ajax objects. You can pass a promise as a parameter to the .add(). A consequence of this is that, you can now pass the promise returned by store.findAll() or store.findRecord() to the .add(). The overall promise returned by the .initiate() resolves only when all the promises resolve.\n\nWhen a promise is passed to the .add(), the sequential flag is set to false and cannot be set to true.\n\nThis is available only from v2.2.8\n\n```javascript\n/* Create a request queue with sequential false */\nvar queue = $L.reqQueue();\n\nvar dummyPromise = new Promise( function( resolve, reject ) {\n    resolve( data );\n} );\n\ndummyPromise.then( function() {\n    // on resolve\n}, function() {\n    // on reject\n} );\n\nvar userPromise = store.findAll( 'user' );\n\nuserPromise.then( function() {\n    // Do something on success\n}, function() {\n    // Do something on failure\n} );\n\n/* Add promises inside it */\nqueue.add( [ dummyPromise, userPromise ] );\n\n/* Initiate the request */\nvar prom = queue.initiate();\n\n/* Handle promise */\nprom.then( function( res ) {\n    /* Resolves when every promise resolves */\n    /* res contains information about the requests that succeeded */\n}, function( res ) {\n    /* Rejects atleast one promises reject */\n    /* res contains information about the requests that succeeded and failed */\n} );\n```\n\nYou can also pass ajax requests along with promises. The request queue processes them and fires the overall callback only when all the requests and promises resolve. As mentioned above, the request queue will not call the responses sequentially even when the sequential flag is set to true.\n\n```javascript\n/* Create a request queue with sequential false */\nvar queue = $L.reqQueue();\n\nvar userPromise = store.findAll( 'user' );\n\nuserPromise.then( function() {\n    // Do something on success\n}, function() {\n    // Do something on failure\n} );\n\n/* Add promises inside it */\nqueue.add( [ {\n    url: '/profile',\n    success: function() {\n        // do stuff on success\n    }\n},\nuserPromise ] );\n\n/* Initiate the request */\nvar prom = queue.initiate();\n\n/* Handle promise */\nprom.then( function( res ) {\n    /* Resolves when every promise resolves */\n    /* res contains information about the requests that succeeded */\n}, function( res ) {\n    /* Rejects atleast one promises reject */\n    /* res contains information about the requests that succeeded and failed */\n} );\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

When it is queued, the first axis gets scrolled to in half the time(duration) after which the other axis starts scrolling completing its animation during the remaining time.\n\n```javascript\n$L( '#queuedContainer' ).scrollTo( 200, { duration: 3000, queue: true } );\n```\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The onAfter callback and the onAfterFirst callback. The onAfterFirst callback is available only when the queue option is set to true and when the first axis completes its scroll. The onAfter callback is fired when the scroll animation fully completes.\n\n```javascript\n$L( '#callbackDiv' ).scrollTo( 200 , { duration: 3000,\n    queue: true,\n    onAfterFirst: function () {\n        // do stuff\n    },\n    onAfter: function() {\n        // do more stuff\n    }\n} );\n```\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

The wait attribute takes a number in milliseconds and only executes the current command if no other keys are matched within the wait period.\nPress command/windows key and s to test the preventDefault attribute. The preventDefault attribute takes a boolean value and prevents the default browser behaviour. By default preventDefault is set to false.\n\n```javascript\nshortcut.registerKey( 'control+c' , function() {\n    console.log( ' Default: control + c clicked! ' );\n} );\n```\n```javascript\nshortcut.registerKey( ' a c ' , function() {\n    console.log( 'Gmail Style Sequence: a c clicked!' );\n} );\n```\n```javascript\nshortcut.registerKey( 'a b a b' , function() {\n    console.log( 'Konami Code: a b a b!' );\n} );\n```\n```javascript\nshortcut.registerKey( ' /\\\\d/i ' , function() {\n    console.log( 'Regex: Some number clicked!' );\n} , {\n    type: 'regex'\n} );\n```\n```javascript\nshortcut.registerKey([\"Meta+l\", \"Control+m\", \"n\"], function () {\n    console.log( 'Array: Meta+L OR Control+m OR n pressed!' );\n})\n```\n```javascript\nshortcut.registerKey( '#' , function() {\n    console.log( '# pressed!' );})\nshortcut.registerKey( 'z+?' , function() {\n    console.log( 'z+? pressed!' );\n} );\n```\n```javascript\nshortcut.registerKey( 'alt' , function() {\n    console.log( 'Alt key pressed once!' );\n}, {\n    wait : 400\n} );\nshortcut.registerKey( 'alt alt' , function() {\n    console.log( 'Alt key pressed twice!' );\n} );\n```\n```javascript\nshortcut.registerKey( 'meta+s' , function() {\n    console.log( ' meta+s! ' );\n}, {\n    preventDefault : True\n} );\n```\n\nRegistering shortcuts with the registerKey() function requires that the key pairs used must be similar to those found in the KeyboardEvent.key API.\nThe key names contained in KeyboardEvent.key should be used to register and unregister shortcut combinations.\nSo that the shortcut can be added for any of the keys directly using the key names given by KeyboardEvent.key.\nLet us consider few examples in which we need to add a shortcuts including the keys $ or Command/Windows Key, so we can do so as follows:\n```javascript\nshortcut.registerKey( '$' , function() {\n    console.log( '$ pressed!' );\n} );\n\nshortcut.registerKey( 'Meta + h' , function() {\n    console.log( 'Meta + h pressed!' );\n} );\n```\n\nYou cannot register multiple callbacks to the same key combination . If you try to register a new callback to an existing shortcut, the existing callback will be replaced by the new callback.\n\nInteraction With Ui Components\n\nA menu is a list of commands available to the user in the current context.\n\nTo invoke a command in the menu by using a shortcut, you have to pass an attribute to the lyte-menu-item tag. The lyte-shortcut attribute passed to the lyte-menu-item tag is an object. It can accept the following keys.\n\n\n\nkey - The keys that need to be pressed to invoke this command.\ntype - Whether it is a regex or not.\nwait - The amount of time to wait in milliseconds before executing the command.\n\n\nNote: The lyte-shortcut is ran through a JSON.parse function so it should be a proper JSON object. An Example is shown below\n\n```html\n<lyte-menu on-menu-click={{method(\"process\")}} lt-prop-event=\"click\" lt-prop-query=\".file-menu\" lt-prop-yield=\"true\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-menu-body class=\"menuBody\">\n            <lyte-menu-group>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"New File Created\" lyte-shortcut='{\"key\":\"control+n\"}'>\n                    <lyte-menu-label>New File</lyte-menu-label>\n                    <lyte-menu-description>Control+N</lyte-menu-description>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"Open File...\" lyte-shortcut='{\"key\":\"control+o\"}'>\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Open File...</lyte-menu-label>\n                    <lyte-menu-description>Control+O</lyte-menu-description>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"Open Folder...\">\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Open Folder...</lyte-menu-label>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"File Saved!\" lyte-shortcut='{\"key\":\"control+s\"}'>\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Save</lyte-menu-label>\n                    <lyte-menu-description>Control+S</lyte-menu-description>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n                    <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"Save As...\" lyte-shortcut='{\"key\":\"control+shift+s\"}'>\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Save As...</lyte-menu-label>\n                    <lyte-menu-description>Control+Shift+S</lyte-menu-description>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"Save All\">\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Save All</lyte-menu-label>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n            </lyte-menu-group>\n            <lyte-menu-group>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"New Window Opened\" lyte-shortcut='{\"key\":\"control+shift+n\"}'>\n                    <lyte-menu-label>New Window</lyte-menu-label>\n                    <lyte-menu-description>Control+Shift+N</lyte-menu-description>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"Window Closed\" lyte-shortcut='{\"key\":\"control+shift+w\"}'>\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Close Window</lyte-menu-label>\n                    <lyte-menu-description>Control+Shift+W</lyte-menu-description>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n            </lyte-menu-group>\n            <lyte-menu-group>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"File Closed\" lyte-shortcut='{\"key\":\"control+w\"}'>\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Close File</lyte-menu-label>\n                    <lyte-menu-description>Control+W</lyte-menu-description>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"revert file\">\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Revert File</lyte-menu-label>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"close all files\">\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Close All Files</lyte-menu-label>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n            </lyte-menu-group>\n            <lyte-menu-group>\n                <lyte-menu-item data-value=\"exit\">\n                    <lyte-menu-label>Exit</lyte-menu-label>\n                </lyte-menu-item>\n            </lyte-menu-group>\n        </lyte-menu-body>\n    </template>\n</lyte-menu>\n```\nShortcuts On Inputs\n\nBy default, lyte-shortcut does not fire when an input/text-area/select/<<element>>[contenteditable=\"true\"] is focused.\nBy default, lyte-shortcut does not fire if classList of active element contain lyteDummyEventContainer.\nTo fire callbacks, simply add the lyte-shortcut class to the corresponding element.\n\nUnregistering Keys\n\nRegistered shortcuts can be unregistered.\n\nunregisterKey() can be used to unregister a particular shortcut.\nunregisterAll() can be used to unregister all the registered shortcuts.\n\n\n```javascript\nshortcut.unregisterKey('control+a');\n```\n```javascript\nshortcut.unregister([\"control+e\", \"f\", \"meta+k\"])\n```\n```javascript\nshortcut.unregisterAll();\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

But when called with class selector, all the elements having that class will share the same callbacks. Have a look at the below code snippet for better understanding.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#selector\").sortable();\nOR\n$L(\".selector\").sortable();\n```\nDependencies\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-sortable.css\" > </link>\n\n<!-- Individual plugin file -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/plugins/lyte-sortable.js\"> </script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-dom/lyte-dom.js\"> </script>\n\n---or----\n<!-- Importing files -->\nimport \"@zoho/lyte-ui-plugins/plugins/lyte-sortable\"\n\nimport \"$L from \"@zoho/lyte-dom\"\n```\nAdd Dynamic Elements\n\nThere are two ways to make dynamically created elements sortable\n\nMethod 1:\n\nCall the addToSortable method. Example\n```javascript\nvar parentElement = $L(\"#selector\")[0];\nparentElement.addToSortable(newChild);\n```\n\nMethod 2:\n\nGet the class from the parent by calling an utility function getSortableClass and add it to the newly created element along with \"sortable-element\" class. Example\n\n```javascript\nvar className = $L( \"#selector\" )[0].getSortableClass ();\n$L( newChild ).addClass( \"sortable-element \" + className );\n```\n\nAny one of the above mentioned ways can be used to make the element sortable.\n\nDestroy\n\nTo destroy the sortable behaviour of the elements, call the sortable method with \"destroy\" as the arguement passed to the method.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#selector\").sortable( \"destroy\" );\nOR\n$L(\".selector\").sortable( \"destroy\" );\n```\nBasic Sortable\n\nA basic sortable allows reordering of the items from the list.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#selector\").sortable();\n```\nConnected Lists\n\nSort items from one list into another and vice versa, by passing a selector into the connectedWith option. The simpliest way is to provide id to the lists and then pass the ids to the sortable function (i.e., connectedWith : \"#id1,#id2\" )\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#connectedList1\").sortable({\n    connectedWith : \"#connectedList2\"\n});\n```\nProperties\n\nBelow explained are some of the properties which helps in customizing the sortable functionality based on your needs. Have a look at the API page for all the properties.\n\ncancel\n\nCancel property is helpful when you want to restrict dragging of the sortable element on clicking on some element(s) which are inside the sortable element. Suppose you have an input field inside a sortable element and you dont want the sortable element to be dragged by holding the input field. So you can provide a selector to the input field and provide that selector as a value to the cancel property. So this will enable us to move the sortable element by holding anywhere else other than the input field inside the sortable element.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#connectedList1\").sortable({\n    cancel : \"input\"\n});\n```\nrestrict\n\nRestrict propety restricts one or more element(s) from being sortable in a group of elements. For example, you dont want the 3rd and the 5th element to be sortable in the below given example. So provide a unique selector to those elements and pass that selector value to restrict property. So all the other elements leaving the 3rd and 5th element will be sortable.\nHere, we have provided restrictItem class to the 3rd and 5th element.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#connectedList1\").sortable({\n    restrict : \".restrictItem\"\n});\n```\nitems\n\nThe sortable element can be dragged or sorted if the mousedown happens on the element matching the selector value passed to the item property. It is similar to handle. If specified, sortable happens only on clicking the matching selector items.\n\nAlthough, both items and cancel helps in restricting sortable of an element, but there is a major difference on its usage. You wont be able to drag any sortable element if the mousedown happens on the specified cancel element where as in case of items, the sortable element can be moved only when mousedown happens on the specified item.\n\nIn the below example, the elements can be dragged only by holding the hamburger button.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#connectedList1\").sortable({\n    items : \".ham-menu\"\n});\n```\ncontainment\n\nIt specifies the element containing the sortable element, outside of which the sortable element cannot be dragged. Containment can take \"parent\" as a value or other valid selector. If \"parent\" is provided as the value then the sortable elements cannot be moved out of its parent container.\nIn the below example, the sortable elements cannot be moved out of the green bordered area.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#connectedList1\").sortable({\n    containment : \".outerDiv\"\n});\n```\nscrollDivX\n\nscrollDivX property specifies the div with the following properties i) overflow-x: scrollable and ii) scrollDiv X must be sortable element's parent.\n\nThis property accepts valid css selector which can uniquely identify the scrollable container.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#connectedList1\").sortable({\n    scrollDivX : \"#scrollDiv\" ,\n    connectedWith : \".nestedSortable\"\n});\n```\ndroppable\n\nSetting the value of the droppable property true will enable the list to accept items from other lists it is connected to, else it won't aceept. By default it is set to true.\n\nThis property accepts boolean value ie. true or false\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#connectedList1\").sortable({\n    connctedWith : [\"#connectedList2\"],\n    droppable : true or false\n});\n```\ndraggable\n\nDraggable property when set to true makes the items from the specified list draggable. By default the value is set to true.\n\nThis property accepts boolean value ie. true or false\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#connectedList1\").sortable({\n    draggable : true or false\n});\n```\nCallbacks - usage\n\nThe example below provides an idea about when the callbacks are invoked. Drag the below element to check. For more details about the callbacks, dive into methods in the API section.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#connectedList1\").sortable({\n    onReady : function( arguments ){\n        \\\\Do Something\n    },\n    onSelect : function( arguments ){\n        \\\\Do Something\n    },\n    onDragStart : function(){\n        \\\\Do Something\n    },\n    onDrag : function( arguments ){\n        \\\\Do Something\n    },\n    onPlaceholder : function( arguments ){\n        \\\\Do Something\n    },\n    onBeforeDrop : function( arguments ){\n        \\\\Do Something\n    },\n    onDrop : function( arguments ){\n        \\\\Do Something\n    }\n});\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

By default it is expected to be a text value.\n\nInclude the below dependency in the required component's js file.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- Individual plugin file -->\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/plugins/lyte-watermark.js\"> </script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-dom/lyte-dom.js\"> </script>\n---or----\n<!-- Importing files -->\nimport \"@zoho/lyte-ui-plugins/plugins/lyte-watermark.js\"\nimport $L from \"@zoho/lyte-dom\";\n```\nUsing image as watermark\n\nThis example depicts the use of an image to watermark an image.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#selector\").watermark({\n    target : 'image.jpg',\n    watermark : 'watermark.png',\n    style : 'image',\n    onComplete : function( img ){\n        document.body.append(img);\n    }\n});\n```\nUsing text as watermark\n\nThis example depicts the use of a text as a watermark to mark an image.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#selector\").watermark({\n    target : 'image.jpg' ,\n    watermark : 'lyte-watermark.js' ,\n    style : 'text' ,\n    position : 'center' ,\n    font : '50px sans-serif' ,\n    alpha : 0.5 ,\n    onComplete : function( img ){\n        document.body.append(img) ;\n    }\n});\n```\nload()\n\nThis example depicts the use of load function. It is useful for writting additional text or adding another watermark image to the watermarked image. We can also use more than one load function to add more watermarks to an image by chaining them one after another. Remember to add the onComplete callback to the last load function to get the final watermarked image.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#selector\").watermark({\n    target : 'image.jpg',\n    watermark : 'watermark.png',\n    style : 'image'\n}).load({\n    watermark : 'SAMPLE',\n    style : 'text',\n    onComplete : function( img ){\n        document.body.append(img) ;\n    }\n});\n```\nCallback - onLoad\n\nCallback onload should be used to customize the position of the watermark in the image. To use it, the value of the position property should be given as custom. The target image and the watermark image(optional - provided only incase an image is used as watermark) are the arguments provided. The function should return the target image after customization.\n\n\nIf position value is given as custom but onLoad is not mentioned, then an error will be thrown.\n\n```javascript\n$L(\"#selector\").watermark({\n    target : 'image.jpg',\n    watermark : 'SAMPLE',\n    style : 'text',\n    onLoad : function ( img ) {\n        var context = target.getContext('2d');\n        var text = 'SAMPLE';\n        var metrics = context.measureText(text);\n        var x = ( target.width / 2 ) - ( metrics.width + 24 );\n        var y = ( target.height / 2 ) + 48 * 2;\n        context.translate( x, y );\n        context.globalAlpha = 0.6;\n        context.fillStyle = 'yellow';\n        context.font = '60px Arial Black';\n        context.rotate ( -45 * Math.PI / 180 );\n        context.fillText ( text, 0, 0 );\n        return target;\n    },\n    onComplete : function ( img ) {\n        document.body.append(img);\n    }\n});\n```\nProperties - Usage\n\nExample depicting the usage of properties for watermark.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

To do so execute the following command.\nlyte install <package> <options> --registry\n\nHere is an example for you\n\nlyte install @slyte/lyte-editor@1.0.4-beta --registry http://cm-npmregistry\n\nBy default, on executing the above command, you can find texteditor as lookups, being added in app.js.\n\nSample Syntax\n```html\n<!-- Sample Syntax -->\n<lyte-editor lt-prop-base-path=\"{ Output Directory }/addons/lyte-editor/dist\"> </lyte-editor>\n```\nSample Lyte Editor\nStandalone Version\n\nFor Non Lyte Applications, Lyte Editor natively supports standalone version ( use lyte-editor@1.0.3 or above ). This means, lyte editor will take care of the installation and loading of its dependencies. Installation of the dependencies will happen in the post-install of the lyte-editor package. After installation, Lyte Editor is builded in production mode and stored in this location\n/node_modules/lyte-editor/addons/lyte-editor/dist/\nFor proper working of the lyte-editor, copy the complete folder into your deployment folder structure (or) use it as such inside the node_modules folder\n\nFor now, this auto installation of dependencies feature will not work inside a lyte application, This feature is for non-lyte applications Therefore,all the dependencies has to be installed manually.\n\nBundling of files (or) changing the directory structure inside the /node_modules/lyte-editor/addons/lyte-editor/dist/ folder will result in unexpected behavior of the lyte-editor\n\nFingerprint URL Mappings\n\nIn standalone version, as lyte-editor takes care of loading the dependencies, the relative file paths of the dependencies are hard-coded into lyte editor (this is the reason why bundling (or) altering the file structure inside the dist folder may break the code)\nIncase your application is using fingerprinted urls to load the files, you might expect the same from lyte-editor.\nFor this use case, it is required to pass the url mappings object into lyte-editor.\n\n```javascript\n// After adding the lyte-editor.js script, loadDependencies API should be called\n// (e.g) lyteEditor.loadDependencies( path_to_dist_of_lyte_editor,  url_mappings_object )\n// Sample Mappings Object\nvar urlMappings = {\n\"/path/to/a/js/file.js\" : \"/path/to/a/js/file_260d6_.js\"\n}\nlyteEditor.loadDependencies(\"/node_modules/lyte-editor/addons/lyte-editor/dist/\",urlMappings)\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

Provide unique selector of lyte-texteditor component to lyte editor panel component. One text editor can have only one editor panel component.\n\n```html\n<lyte-editorpanel lt-prop-editor = \"lyte-texteditor.iconEditor\" ></lyte-editorpanel>\n<lyte-texteditor class = 'iconEditor'></lyte-texteditor>\n```\nJSON to html string\n\nYou can convert texteditor's JSON output as html at anytime. For Server side conversion you can use this Jar. For client side conversion you can use lyte-texteditor's jsonToString util defined in _lyteUiEditor global variable\n\n```javascript\n_lyteUiEditor.jsonToString( JsonArray, config ); // it will return html string\n\nJsonArray => Should be in the same format of lyte-texteditor's output\n\nconfig ( optional ) => configurations of texteditor. If not provided default values will be used for conversion.\n```\n```javascript\nimport lyte.utils.lytetexteditor.LyteConvertor;\n\n/* In your code */\n\nLyteConvertor convertor = new LyteConvertor(); // it will return html string\n\nString html = convertor.convert2html( Json_Array, config );\n\n/* Notes */\n\nJsonArray => Should be in the same format of lyte-texteditor's output\n\nconfig ( optional ) => configurations of texteditor. If not provided default values defined in the jar will be used for conversion.\n\n/*Dependencies*/\n\njson-simple-1.1.jar\n```\nUpdating output\n\nYou can update output html on each modifications happens in the texteditor component. In this texteditor rerenders modified word or paragraph alone in the output element.\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lyte-texteditor/components/helpers/editor-update-html.js\"></script> file.\nCall _lyteUiEditor.updateHtml in on-queue-push method\n\n```html\n<lyte-editorpanel lt-prop-editor = \".queuePush\"></lyte-editorpanel>\n<lyte-texteditor lt-prop-word-attributes = true lt-prop-generate-id = true class = \"queuePush\" on-queue-push = \"{{method('queuePush')}}\"></lyte-texteditor>\n\n<div class = \"queuePushOutput\"></div>\n```\n```javascript\nmethods : {\n\n\tqueuepush : function( item, frm, $node ){\n\t\tvar container = $L( '.queuePushOutput', this.$node ).get( 0 );\n\t\t_lyteUiEditor.updateHtml( container, item, frm, $node );\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

listview in detail. To render a list view, mandatory property like ltPropContent and ltProphaeder has to be given.\n\nAll the cell contents can be rendered through yield. By default lyte-yield having name \"yield\" will be rendered for all the cells. You can also specify yield name for a particular column in that column data(lt-prop-header). Row and column data will be passed to the yield. You can use that as rowData and columnData just like the below code snippet.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button onclick=\"{{action('showFilter')}}\">\n\t\t<template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name =

You need to mention the pinned position in that particular column data.\n\nHeader resize\n\nYou can render headers with ltPropHeader ltPropHeader and its ltPropSubHeader in table. You can make header cells as resizable.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Internationalization\n\nSome of the UI components require i18n files to work. The default text provided by the UI components can be internationalized by importing the i18n files of the language currently being used in the website.\n\nOnly the text used by UI components by default can be internationalized. It should be noted that if you are using your own text in UI components, such texts can't be internationalized.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button>\n   <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n     Perform An Action\n   </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n\nIn the above example the \"Perform an action\" does not get internationalized. It is the job of the developer to internationalize it. On the other hand, the month names rendered in lyte-calendar do get internationalized because they are the default part of UI components.\n\nComponents requiring i18n are:\n\nlyte-calendar\nlyte-dropdown\nlyte-daterangepicker\nlyte-colorpicker\nlyte-dragdrop\nlyte-input\n\nThe following languages are supported by UI components.\n\nBulgarian\tChinese\tChinese-Taiwan\tCroatian\tCzech\nDanish\tEnglish-UK\tEnglish-US\tFrench\tGerman\nHungarian\tItalian\tJapanese\tHebrew\tHindi\nNetherlands\tPolish\tPortuguese-brazil\tPortuguese-portugal\tKorean\nRussian\tSpanish\tSwedish\tTurkish\tVietnamese\n\nInclude the following dependencies\n\n```html\n<!-- i18n files -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/I18n\" />\n<!-- files end-->\n```\n\nWhen you are changing the language in your application make sure to import the appropriate i18n file for the UI components as well. The i18n file is in the form of JSON, so bringing in a different language file replaces the old one.\n\nFor example: Lets say initially, the website renders in English and the en_US.js file is loaded for UI components. Later on, when the user switches from English to French, simply bringing in the fr_FR.js file will change the language of UI components.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

The default theme is inherited at the start and its variable values are applied to the different styles in the styles/{component.less} file.\n\tThe next level of inheritance is the Custom theme level. Any matching variables/mixins between the default and packaged theme are overriden by the Custom theme variables. These overriden variable values are then applied to the different styles in the styles/{component.less} file. Custom themes are generally created for entire products. These themes can then be reused by another product by simply adding it to their themeing interface.\n\n\nSo the theme inheritance order is:\n\nDefault theme's variables/mixins are inherited\nCustom theme's variables/mixins are inherited and they replace default theme's variables/mixins\nThe resulting variables/mixins are then applied to the styles/{component}.less file.\nBaseline Theme\n\nThe default theme contains baseline values which are required for the ui-components to function properly. The values of these variables can be found in the css/themes/default/{ui-elements or globals}/{component-name}.variables.less .\n\nCreating A Custom Theme\n\nTo create your own custom theme, create a new folder under css/themes/ with the name of the theme as the folder name and add your component files.\n\nTo make changes to variables/mixins of the default theme when creating a packaged theme, make changes to the css/themes/{theme-name}/{ui-elements or global}/{component-name}/{component-name}.variables.less\n\nTo add new styles to your theme, add them in the css/themes/{theme-name}/{ui-elements or global}/{component-name}/{component-name}.styles.less\n\n\n\nSet the component variable name to the name of the custom theme created in the config.less file to use it. For eg, if you created new styles for your accordion, change the @accordion variable to name of the new theme.\n\n/* global */   \n\n   \n\n@themeName: 'vibrant';    // Using your theme     \n\n   \n\n@global: @themeName;   \n\n   \n\n/* components */   \n\n   \n\n@accordion: @themeName;     \n\n@autocomplete :  @themeName;   \n\n@breadcrumb :  @themeName;   \n\n@button:  @themeName;   \n\n@nav:  @themeName;   \n\n@checkbox:  @themeName;   \n\n@calendar:  @themeName;   \n\n@gridstack :  @themeName;   \n\n@menu :  @themeName;   \n\n@navigator :  @themeName;   \n\n@radiobutton:  @themeName;   \n\n@slider :  @themeName;   \n\n@search :  @themeName;   \n\n@step :  @themeName;   \n\n@table :  @themeName;   \n\n@tooltip :  @themeName;   \n\n@scrollbar :  @themeName;   \n\n@dropdown:  @themeName;   \n\n@input:  @themeName;   \n\n@popover:  @themeName;   \n\n@alert:  @themeName;   \n\n@messagebox:  @themeName;   \n\n@dragdrop:  @themeName;   \n\n@tabs:  @themeName;   \n\n@colorpicker:  @themeName;   \n\n@progressbar:  @themeName;   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nYou can now compile to obtain the output.\n\nlessc compiler.less output.css\n\nWhen you are compiling compiler.less, make sure the @themeName variable is set. Set it to a theme name and then compile it.\n\nThe compiler.less contains all the component less files(styles/{component.less}) that are going to be compiled. If you don't want any file in the result you can remove its entry from this file.\n\nMaking Changes To Variables\n\nSay we want to make a theme and in that theme we want to change the padding of lyte-accordion-header tag. Open the styles/accordion.less and scroll down to find the style of the lyte-accordion-header-tag.\n\n\n\n/* LYTE-ACCORDION-HEADER TAG STYLES */   \n\n   \n\nlyte-accordion-header{   \n\n       .lyteAccordionHeader();        // Mixin of lyte-accordion-header     \n\n    display: block;   \n\n       padding: @padding;        // Variable we want to change     \n\n    cursor: pointer;   \n\n    background-color: @background-color;   \n\n    box-sizing: @boxSizing;   \n\n    color: @color;   \n\n    height: @height;   \n\n}   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAs you can tell, lyte-accordion-header's style definition has a mixin in the name of lyteAccordionHeader . The @padding variable which we want to change can be found in the theme/themes/default/ui-elements/accordion.variables.less under the same mixin name.\n\n/* LYTE-ACCORDION-HEADER */   \n\n   \n\n.lyteAccordionHeader(){      // The mixin definition     \n\n\t@padding : 1em;       Its padding value     \n\n\t@boxSizing: content-box;   \n\n\t@background-color : @lightGrey;   \n\n\t@color : #333;   \n\n\t@height : 2em;   \n\n}   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nChange its value in your variables file of your theme which is located in theme/themes/{custom-theme-name}/ui-elements/accordion.variables.less .(Don't change it in the default theme)\n\n.lyteAccordionHeader() {   \n\n\t@padding: 1.5em; // This value replaces the value in the default variables file.   \n\n}   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nCompiling again will yield you the necessary CSS changes. Similarly to add new styles apart from the ones provided in the styles/ directory use the overrides file of the component for the custom file that you have created. For eg, if you are writing a new custom theme, then write your new styles in css/themes/{theme-name}/{global or ui-elements}/{component-name}/{component-name}.styles.less\n\n\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

These documents will try to explain functionalities of less/slyte-cli but it would be better to read about them before proceeding further. The document also assumes that you have nodejs and slyte-cli installed.\n\nCreating an App\n\nTo be able to use themeing in slyte, you will need a slyte app. To create one use the following example command in your terminal:\n\n```javascript\nslyte new blog-app\n```\n\nRunning the above command, will create a folder called blog-app. Move into the newly created folder.\n\n```html\ncd blog-app\n```\nSetting Up An Environment\n\nFirst create a directory inside the blog-app directory.\n\n```javascript\nmkdir css\n```\n\nThis directory will contain the less files required for themeing. You can also have your own name for the directoy. To give your own name, open build.js file in build/ folder and in the setCustomConfiguration function, change the argument of path.join() for themes key. (The build/ folder will be found inside the blog-app folder that you moved into)\n\n```javascript\nsetCustomConfiguration : function(options) {\n   // other code\n    var folders = {\n        // other code\n        themes : path.join('css'), // Change the argument to css to something you want.\n        // other code\n    };\n    // other code\n}\n```\n\nAfter creating the themeing folder(css/), it is required to add the less configuration file. The name of the file is less-min-conf.json and should be created inside the build/ folder which can be found inside the blog-app folder created at the start.\n\nMove into the build folder and create the file\n\n```javascript\ncd build/\ntouch less-min-conf.json\n```\n\nIn the next section, we will see how to add a less file for our component and how to compile it to get an output.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Compiling a Less file\nCreating the File\n\nFirst we need to create the less file we need to compile. Since we already have a welcome-comp in our app(you can check this by opening the components/ folder), we will create a corresponding less file for this component.\n\nTo do this, move into the css folder we created in the previous section and create a folder called styles/ inside it(The styles/ folder is created to separate the styles and variables - more on this later).\n\nMove into the styles folder and create a less file called welcome-comp.less\n\n```javascript\ncd css\nmkdir styles\ncd styles\ntouch welcome-comp.less\n```\nAdding Styles\n\nOpen the less file that you have created and add styles inside it. Since our welcome-comp has a h1 tag inside it, we will add it a color\n\n```javascript\nh1 {\n    color: blue;\n}\n```\nConfiguring Build\n\nOnce you have added the styles into the file, then go back to the root directory of your app. There you will find a build/ folder. Move into the build folder and open build.js with your favourite editor. Try searching for options.theming. Initially, this key would be set to false. Make it true.\n\n```javascript\ncd ../../ //Move to the root folder\ncd build/\nopen build.js\n```\n```javascript\n// other code\nbuild: async function (options) {\n  /* watcher */\n  buildOptions = options;\n  options.theming = true; // Change this to true\n  options.sourceMap = false;\n}\n```\n\nNow inside the same build/ folder, open the less-min-conf.json file. We created this file at the end of the last section and we called it the configuration file. This file helps converting the less file we created into css files. This conversion happens during lyte build(it even watches the files and compiles files on the fly). Add the following:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"welcome-comp.css\": [ \"styles/welcome-comp.less\" ]\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, it can be seen that the welcome-comp.less we created is compiled to the welcome-comp.css file. You can have multiple less files in the right hand side and when any one of them change the css file is generated.\n\nIt can be seen that the path of the files is relative to css/ folder that we have created.\n\nAdd the following code to compile the Less file to CSS file.\n\n```javascript\nvar json, data;\ntry {\n  data = fs.readFileSync(path.join(options.root, 'build/less-min-conf.json'), 'utf-8');\n  json = JSON.parse(data);\n\n    for (key in json) {\n        await buildUtils.compileThemes({\n          src: json[key],\n          dist: 'compiledCSS/' + key\n        });\n  }\n} catch (e) {\n  options.log.user({\n    msg: e.message,\n    color: 'red'\n  })\n  // To stop the build process incase of any error\n  // process.exit()\n\n}\n```\n\nThis reads the less min-config.js file and creates the corresponding CSS file from the Less file.\n\nHere, src points the Less file that has to be compiled and the dist points the location where the CSS file will reside.\n\nCompile\n\nOnce done, then it is time to compile. Move to the root folder and run slyte build.\n\n```javascript\ncd..\nslyte build\n```\n\nNow if you open the dist/ folder that is created and open the complied css/ folder inside it you will see the welcome-comp.css file. Again it can be seen that the output path is relative to the css folder.\n\nStructure\n\nThis is the final folder structure.\n\nbuild/\n\nbuild.js\n\nless-min-conf.json\n\ncomponents/\n\njavascript/\n\nwelcome-comp.js\n\ntemplates/\n\nwelcome-comp.html\n\ndist/\n\ncss/\n\nstyles/\n\nwelcome-comp.less\n\nwelcome-comp.css\n\ncss/\n\nstyles/\n\nwelcome-comp.less\n\nResult\n\nGet the created compiled css file into your index.html file using a link tag and then you should be able to see the text color of the h1 tag turn to blue after running slyte serve.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"dist/css/welcome-comp.css\" />\n```\n```javascript\nslyte serve // To see the output in localhost:3000\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Styles and variables\n\nSeparating Styles And Variables\n\nIn the last document, we created a styles/ folder and we mentioned about the separation of styles and variables. This separation is important for themeing in lyte especially when you are trying to create multiple themes. Lets take an example of a light mode/dark mode theme that you might need in your web app.\n\nBut First\n\nWhat do we mean by styles and variables? Well the styles represent the actual css rules used on your elements and the variables are the values of the css properties used in the rules.\n\n```css\n@import \"../themes/myVariables.less\";\n\nh1 {\n\tcolor: @headerTextColor;\n\tpadding: @headerPadding;\n\tborder: @headerBorder;\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, the h1 css rule is what we call the style and the @headerTextColor, @headerPadding and @headerBorder are what we call the variables. The h1 css rule is defined in styles/ whereas the @headerTextColor, @headerPadding and @headerBorder are defined inside another folder(called themes/). These variables are then imported into the styles file and then used which can be seen in the first line.\n\nLet us try to style our h1 tag in our welcome-comp.html. First open the styles/welcome-comp.less file that you created in the last section and add the snippet you see above.\n\nNext we will create the variables folder. From the root directory of your project(blog-app/), move into the css/ folder. Then run the following commands\n\n```html\ncd css/\nmkdir themes\ncd themes/\ntouch myVariables.less\n```\n\nThe above will create a myVariables.less file in your newly created themes/ folder. Open the file in any text editor and add the follow lines\n\n```css\n@headerTextColor: blue;\n@headerPadding: 20px;\n@headerBorder: solid 1px brown;\n```\n\nNow navigate back to the root directory and run slyte serve and open your app.\n\n```html\ncd ../../\nslyte serve\n```\n\nWhen you open the app, you will find that the styles defined above were applied to the element.\n\nPhilosophy Of Themeing in Lyte\n\nLets say your company decides to build two themes, light mode and dark mode for your webapp. The designers come with up their mockups and prototypes for how the app should look for the two different modes. You look at the mocks and try to come up with ways to maintain the css files for the two different themes. What you realize is, although there are two modes which are visually distinctive, the things that changed are not the css rules themselves but the values of the properties of the css rules. Now there are various ways to go about achieving this. You may decide to add a class to body tag to distinguish the mode and change the values of properties from the class or you might bring in a new css file for the dark mode that overrides some of the values of properties of light mode css. But in lyte, we separate the styles and the variables(values of properties) for the above reason. When we want to create a new theme, we simply change the variables and apply it on the same styles. This allows us to make new themes without a big hassle since the CLI essentially takes care of the build step. Now it is a bit more complicated than this but this is the general gist of it.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Multiple Themes\n\nImplementing Multiple Themes\n\nIn the last section, we talked about the philosophy of themeing in lyte. We talked about how the styles and variables are separated and how different variables(corresponding to different themes) are applied to the same styles to create new themes. In this section, we will try to implement an example of light/dark mode themes to get a better understanding of the lyte themeing engine.\n\nCreating the files\n\nIn the last section, we created the myVariables.less file inside the themes/ folder. Let us remove this file. From the project root, run the following commands.\n\n```html\ncd css/themes/\nrm myVariables.less\n```\n\nOnce done, let us add the two themes - light and dark inside the themes/ folder. Run the following commands.\n\n```html\nmkdir light\nmkdir dark\n```\n\nThe two folders created will hold variable values for the light theme and the dark theme. Move into the folders and create a variables file for the welcome-comp.less. We recommend you create a style file and variable file for each individual component in your app the same way you would maintain a css file for each individual component. We already have a style file inside styles/ folder called welcome-comp.less. Similarly, create variables inside the themes/light and themes/dark as follows.\n\n```css\ncd light\ntouch welcome-comp.variables.less\ncd ..\ncd dark\ntouch welcome-comp.variables.less\n```\n\nIn the above commands, you can see that we have added a .variables suffix. This is just a convention. You can name the variable file the way you want but we recommend the above. Now lets add some variables to the light and dark themes.\n\n```css\n@headerTextColor: black;\n@headerPadding: 20px;\n@headerMargin: 20px;\n@headerBorder: solid 1px black;\n@background: white;\n```\n```css\n@headerTextColor: white;\n@headerBorder: solid 1px white;\n@background: black;\n```\n\nChange your styles file into something like this(styles/welcome-comp.less).\n\n```css\n@import (multiple,optional) \"../themes/light/welcome-comp.variables.less\";\n@import (multiple,optional) \"../themes/@{theme}/welcome-comp.variables.less\";\n\nh1 {\n    color: @headerTextColor;\n    padding: @headerPadding;\n    margin: @headerMargin;\n    border: @headerBorder;\n    background: @background;\n}\n```\nExplaining The Three Files Created\n\nNow in the previous section, we created three files - 1 style file and 2 variables. Let us look at the variable files first. In the light theme's variable file(themes/light/welcome-comp.variables.less), we have created five variables - headerTextColor, headerPadding, headerMargin, headerBorder and background. But in the dark theme's variable file(themes/dark/welcome-comp.variables.less), we have only used three variables - headerTextColor, headerBorder and background. The reason for only creating three variables in the dark variables file is because we want to change only the properties that are going to change across themes and not create an entire new set of variables. Think of it this way. The light theme is the base theme - the values of properties(variables) inside it is going to be shared by multiple themes. Except for a few properties like background color, textcolor or border color most of the properties across themes remain the same and we don't want to spend time putting those variable values in our new themes(instead reuse them). So we add only the variables that need to change in the dark theme.\n\nAnd this is reflected in our implementation of styles files. You can see that the first imported file is the light variables file(which acts as a base theme). After which we import the variable file of a particular theme.(@{theme} in the example above in the import statement is a variable which can take the values light or dark. When it takes the value light the statement becomes - @import \"../themes/light/welcome-comp.variables.less\" and when it takes dark it becomes - @import \"../themes/dark/welcome-comp.variables.less\").\n\nFinal Configuration\n\nTo get the ball rolling we need to do one final configuration. Go the project root directory and move into the build/ folder and open the build.js file and add the following code snippet.\n\n```css\nbuild: async function(options, dependencies) {\n    // ...\n    // ...\n    // ...\n    await buildUtils.init(options); /* Provides options to buildUtils.*/\n\n\n    // Snippet Begins here\n\n    var json, data;\n    try {\n        data = fs.readFileSync('build/less-min-conf.json', 'utf-8');\n        json = JSON.parse(data);\n        var themes = [ 'light', 'dark' ], key;\n\n        themes.forEach( async function( theme ) {\n            for (key in json) {\n                options.themeOptions = {\n                    globalVars: {\n                        theme: theme\n                    }\n                }\n\n                await buildUtils.compileThemes({\n                    src: json[key],\n                    dist: 'compiledCSS/' + theme + '/' + key\n                });\n            }\n        } );\n    } catch (e) {\n        options.log.user({\n            msg: e,\n            color: 'red'\n        })\n\n    }\n\n    // Snippet ends here\n\n\n    /* Building of modules starts. Custom modules can be added in build function.*/\n    await buildUtils.build(['copyAppDir', 'routes', 'components', 'models', 'helpers', 'mixins']);\n    // ...\n    // ...\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nThe snippet might look complex but its really simple. It first declares two themes - light and dark referenced by the themes array. It then reads the less-min-conf.json that we created in the first section. Then for each theme we've declared and for each entry in less-min-conf.json, we manually compile the less file into the css file which is what the await buildUtils.compileThemes(); function does. The src key is the source path and the dist key is the destination(Again destination can be configured the way you want it). One more thing is the options.themeOptions = {}; line. Remember that we declared a @{theme} variable in our import statement and that variable is still undefined(we never really defined the variable anywhere although it is being used). The value of this variable is passed from over here through options.themeOptions - light and dark.\n\nSo if you want to add a new theme, create the folders like you did above and declare a new string in the themes array above.(lets say our new theme's name is summer. Then the themes array is [ 'light', 'dark', 'summer' ]).\n\nAlso one more thing to note here is the destination path. The dist key is declared in such a way that the output will be present inside dist/compiledCSS/light/welcome-comp.css and dist/compiledCSS/dark/welcome-comp.css.\n\nMove to the root folder and run slyte build to see the result\n\n```html\ncd ..\nslyte build\n```\n\nImport the built css file in your index.html file and run your app to see how it works. All you need to do is bring in either the dist/css/compiledCSS/light/welcome-comp.css for light theme or the dist/css/compiledCSS/dark/welcome-comp.css for dark theme.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"dist/css/compiledCSS/light/welcome-comp.css\" />\n```\nFinal Folder Structure\n\nThe final folder structure can be summed up as follows.\n\nbuild/\n\nbuild.js\n\nless-min-conf.json\n\ncomponents/\n\njavascript/\n\nwelcome-comp.js\n\ntemplates/\n\nwelcome-comp.html\n\ndist/\n\ncss/\n\nthemes/\n\ndark\n\nwelcome-comp.variables.less\n\nlight\n\nwelcome-comp.variables.less\n\nstyles/\n\nwelcome-comp.less\n\ncompiledCSS\n\ndark\n\nwelcome-comp.css\n\nlight\n\nwelcome-comp.css\n\ncss/\n\nstyles/\n\nwelcome-comp.less\n\nthemes/\n\ndark\n\nwelcome-comp.variables.less\n\nlight\n\nwelcome-comp.variables.less\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

But before proceeding, make sure you have a npm or bower version of ui-components installed in your app. For this example, we will be using version 3.35.0 as it was the latest during the time of writing this documentation. This might be different from the version that you are using but the steps remain the same.\n\nIf you have already installed lyte-ui-components, skip to the next section.\n\nOpen the package.json in the project root directory of your blog-app and add lyte-ui-component and lyte-dom entry in dependencies\n\n```javascript\n{\n    \"name\": \"blog-app\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"description\": \"Description for blog-app goes here\",\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n    },\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"license\": \"ISC\",\n    \"dependencies\": {\n        \"@zoho/lyte-ui-component\": \"3.35.0\",\n        \"@zoho/lyte-dom\": \"2.0.10\"\n    },\n    \"devDependencies\": {},\n    \"addons\": [\n        \"lyte-ui-component\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nOnce done, run the following command\n\n```html\nnpm install --registry http://integ-docker:4873\n```\n\nThis will create a node_modules/@zoho folder with lyte-ui-component and lyte-dom as packages inside it.\n\nChanging the button styles\n\nLet us try to change the style of lyte-button component as a simple example. To do this, you need to create a lyte-button.less(or a file name of your choice) style file in the styles/ folder. Run the following commands to do this.\n\n```html\ncd css\ncd styles\ntouch lyte-button.less\n```\n\nSimilarly, create a variables file for lyte-button for both light and dark theme.\n\n```html\ncd ..\ncd themes/dark\ntouch lyte-button.variables.less\ncd ..\ncd light\ntouch lyte-button.variables.less\n```\nAdding Styles\n\nNow its time to change the styles of lyte-button. Open the lyte-button.less styles file and add the following snippet inside it.\n\n```css\n@import \"../../node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/theme/styles/button.less\";\n\n@import \"../themes/@{theme}/lyte-button.variables.less\";\n```\n\nWe will explain the snippets and what the paths in the import statements mean. Similarly, open the lyte-button.variables.less file for both light and dark themes and add the following snippets. In our example, we are going to change the color of the default button for both the light and dark themes(We will explain the weird looking syntax in the below variable files as well).\n\n```javascript\n.defaultBtn() {\n     @bg: dodgerblue;\n}\n```\n```javascript\n.defaultBtn() {\n     @bg: black;\n}\n```\nExplaining Everything\n\nNow the first thing to know is that the lyte-ui-component package is itself a lyte-app and it follows a similar themeing folder structure to the one we saw in the previous section. If you were to open node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component, you might come across a folder called theme/ and if you were to open that you will find that it has a folder structure similar to the one that we created. It has a styles/ folder which harbors all the styles of the components and it has a themes/ folder which has the variables for the different themes. And if you were to open the node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/theme/styles/button.less you would see that it imports these variables the same way we imported the variables in our app.\n\nSo the first import statement in our example(css/styles/lyte-button.less), brings in this styles file (@import \"../../node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/theme/styles/button.less\"). Because to be able to change the styles of the button you need to bring in its styles. Similarly, if you want to change the styles of the accordion, you bring in \"../../node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/theme/styles/accordion.less\".\n\nThe next import in the styles file is self explanatory. We bring the variables for each of the themes.\n\nNow to explaining the variable files that we have created. Before explaining the code, open the node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/themes/default/ui-elements/button/button.variables.less. As we said before, the themes/ folder holds in the variables and the file we are trying to open right now is the variables file for the lyte-button created in ui-components. Opening this file, you might find a bunch of code that looks like css rules but these are called mixins. Mixins are created to reuse a piece of code over and over again. But in our case we are using it for namespacing purposes. If every variable were to be in the global namespace, it would cause variable name conflicts or variables with long names. To prevent this, we wrap the variables inside mixins. The mixins have a name like .defaultBtn() and the variables defined inside do not leak into the outer scope. We then import these mixins inside the css rules and use them. You can open the node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/theme/styles/button.less and see how these mixins are used. They are declared at the top of each css rule as follows. There are other ways to namespace your variables as well. To learn more about mixins and namespacing in general, visit lessjs docs.\n\n```css\n.lyteDefaultBtn {\n    .DefaultBtn(); // Mixin used here and the values inside the mixin like @bg, @color and @border are available inside only this style\n    background: @bg;\n    color: @color;\n    border: @border;\n}\n```\n\nSo in our variable files, we are changing the value of the @bg variable of the .defaultBtn() mixin which is used inside the lyteDefaultBtn class. It should be noted that knowing which mixin(the variable) to change will require the developer to inspect the ui-component under question using chrome web dev tools/firefox developer tools/etc to find out which css rule is being applied to the element. Then search for that css rule inside the node_modules/lyte_ui_component/theme/styles/component.less to find the mixin. From there you can change it in your variables. We have tried to name the mixins in a reasonable way to give hints about their use but it would be in the best interest of the developer to make sure they are changing the proper mixin.\n\nFinal Configuration\n\nBefore compiling, there is one final thing configuration left to do. That is the developer must choose which theme of lyte-ui-components must be used to build the styles/lyte-button.less. The styles/lyte-button.less in our blog-app imports the styles/button.less from lyte-ui-components and there are multiple themes in lyte-ui-components(To find the themes available in lyte-ui-component open theme/themes/ folder). We need to tell the compiler to choose a particular theme from these set of themes. To do this open the build.js file and add the following changes.\n\n```css\nbuild: async function(options, dependencies) {\n    // ...\n    // ...\n    // ...\n    await buildUtils.init(options); /* Provides options to buildUtils.*/\n\n\n    // Snippet Begins here\n\n    var json, data;\n    try {\n        data = fs.readFileSync('build/less-min-conf.json', 'utf-8');\n        json = JSON.parse(data);\n        var themes = [ 'light', 'dark' ], key;\n\n        themes.forEach( async function( theme ) {\n            for (key in json) {\n                options.themeOptions = {\n                    globalVars: {\n                        theme: theme,\n                        themeName: 'default', // We are choosing the default theme from ui-components\n                        direction: 'ltr' // This is added so that we use the ltr direction less variables\n                    }\n                }\n\n                await buildUtils.compileThemes({\n                    src: json[key],\n                    dist: 'compiledCSS/' + theme + '/' + key\n                });\n            }\n        } );\n    } catch (e) {\n        options.log.user({\n            msg: e,\n            color: 'red'\n        })\n\n    }\n\n    // Snippet ends here\n\n\n    /* Building of modules starts. Custom modules can be added in build function.*/\n    await buildUtils.build(['copyAppDir', 'routes', 'components', 'models', 'helpers', 'mixins']);\n    // ...\n    // ...\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the above snippet, it can be seen that we have made two changes and both of them to the options.themeOptions object. We have added a new key called themeName with value default and another key called direction with value ltr. The themeName key tells the compiler to use the default theme of lyte-ui-components and similarly the direction keys tells the compiler to use the left to right less variables. After this now we are ready to compile.\n\nThe themeName and direction variable are reserved variable names for lyte-ui-components.\n\nNote when you import styles from lyte-ui-components, you also import variables and there can be clash in variable names. So make sure to namespace your variables.\n\nCompile\n\nOnce you are done adding all the snippets, add an entry in less-min-conf.json as follows and run lyte build/serve and add a lyte-button example inside welcome-comp.html to see the result.\n\n```css\n{\n    \"welcome-comp.css\": [ \"styles/welcome-comp.less\" ],\n    \"lyte-button.css\": [ \"styles/lyte-button.less\" ]\n}\n```\n```css\n<lyte-button>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        click me\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n\nMake sure to bring in the lyte-button dependencies. But this time, you don't have to bring in the node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/theme/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-button.css as this file is built by our blog-app during lyte serve.(Remember we import the entire styles file of lyte-button in our app's style file).\n\n```html\nlyte serve\n```\n\nDon't forget to import the css file\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"dist/css/compiledCSS/light/lyte-button.css\" />\n```\n\nThe variables in lyte-ui-components are present inside theme/themes/@{themeName}/ui-elements\n\nThe theme/themes/@{themeName}/global represents the global variables used inside lyte-ui-components. This can be things like font-size, primary color, primary text color, header colors, border-radius, etc.\n\nThe theme/overrides is deprecated.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data. We do have a host of other libraries, tools and extensions which ease the app development making it faster to build apps using sLyte.\n\nGit RepoRelease Notes Forum"

The default theme is inherited at the start and its variable values are applied to the different styles in the styles/{component.less} file.\n\tThe next level of inheritance is the Custom theme level. Any matching variables/mixins between the default and packaged theme are overriden by the Custom theme variables. These overriden variable values are then applied to the different styles in the styles/{component.less} file. Custom themes are generally created for entire products. These themes can then be reused by another product by simply adding it to their themeing interface.\n\n\nSo the theme inheritance order is:\n\nDefault theme's variables/mixins are inherited\nCustom theme's variables/mixins are inherited and they replace default theme's variables/mixins\nThe resulting variables/mixins are then applied to the styles/{component}.less file.\nBaseline Theme\n\nThe default theme contains baseline values which are required for the ui-components to function properly. The values of these variables can be found in the css/themes/default/{ui-elements or globals}/{component-name}.variables.less .\n\nCreating A Custom Theme\n\nTo create your own custom theme, create a new folder under css/themes/ with the name of the theme as the folder name and add your component files.\n\nTo make changes to variables/mixins of the default theme when creating a packaged theme, make changes to the css/themes/{theme-name}/{ui-elements or global}/{component-name}/{component-name}.variables.less\n\nTo add new styles to your theme, add them in the css/themes/{theme-name}/{ui-elements or global}/{component-name}/{component-name}.styles.less\n\n\n\nSet the component variable name to the name of the custom theme created in the config.less file to use it. For eg, if you created new styles for your accordion, change the @accordion variable to name of the new theme.\n\n/* global */   \n\n   \n\n@themeName: 'vibrant';    // Using your theme     \n\n   \n\n@global: @themeName;   \n\n   \n\n/* components */   \n\n   \n\n@accordion: @themeName;     \n\n@autocomplete :  @themeName;   \n\n@breadcrumb :  @themeName;   \n\n@button:  @themeName;   \n\n@nav:  @themeName;   \n\n@checkbox:  @themeName;   \n\n@calendar:  @themeName;   \n\n@gridstack :  @themeName;   \n\n@menu :  @themeName;   \n\n@navigator :  @themeName;   \n\n@radiobutton:  @themeName;   \n\n@slider :  @themeName;   \n\n@search :  @themeName;   \n\n@step :  @themeName;   \n\n@table :  @themeName;   \n\n@tooltip :  @themeName;   \n\n@scrollbar :  @themeName;   \n\n@dropdown:  @themeName;   \n\n@input:  @themeName;   \n\n@popover:  @themeName;   \n\n@alert:  @themeName;   \n\n@messagebox:  @themeName;   \n\n@dragdrop:  @themeName;   \n\n@tabs:  @themeName;   \n\n@colorpicker:  @themeName;   \n\n@progressbar:  @themeName;   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\nYou can now compile to obtain the output.\n\nlessc compiler.less output.css\n\nWhen you are compiling compiler.less, make sure the @themeName variable is set. Set it to a theme name and then compile it.\n\nThe compiler.less contains all the component less files(styles/{component.less}) that are going to be compiled. If you don't want any file in the result you can remove its entry from this file.\n\nMaking Changes To Variables\n\nSay we want to make a theme and in that theme we want to change the padding of lyte-accordion-header tag. Open the styles/accordion.less and scroll down to find the style of the lyte-accordion-header-tag.\n\n\n\n/* LYTE-ACCORDION-HEADER TAG STYLES */   \n\n   \n\nlyte-accordion-header{   \n\n       .lyteAccordionHeader();        // Mixin of lyte-accordion-header     \n\n    display: block;   \n\n       padding: @padding;        // Variable we want to change     \n\n    cursor: pointer;   \n\n    background-color: @background-color;   \n\n    box-sizing: @boxSizing;   \n\n    color: @color;   \n\n    height: @height;   \n\n}   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nAs you can tell, lyte-accordion-header's style definition has a mixin in the name of lyteAccordionHeader . The @padding variable which we want to change can be found in the theme/themes/default/ui-elements/accordion.variables.less under the same mixin name.\n\n/* LYTE-ACCORDION-HEADER */   \n\n   \n\n.lyteAccordionHeader(){      // The mixin definition     \n\n\t@padding : 1em;       Its padding value     \n\n\t@boxSizing: content-box;   \n\n\t@background-color : @lightGrey;   \n\n\t@color : #333;   \n\n\t@height : 2em;   \n\n}   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n   \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nChange its value in your variables file of your theme which is located in theme/themes/{custom-theme-name}/ui-elements/accordion.variables.less .(Don't change it in the default theme)\n\n.lyteAccordionHeader() {   \n\n\t@padding: 1.5em; // This value replaces the value in the default variables file.   \n\n}   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\nCompiling again will yield you the necessary CSS changes. Similarly to add new styles apart from the ones provided in the styles/ directory use the overrides file of the component for the custom file that you have created. For eg, if you are writing a new custom theme, then write your new styles in css/themes/{theme-name}/{global or ui-elements}/{component-name}/{component-name}.styles.less\n\n\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 190,
    "content": "Commands in CLI\n\nOnce you have installed CLI, you will have access to all CLI commands in your terminal. Using the CLI commands, you will be able to perform a variety of operations on your application such as creating a new project, generating a new component, building the application, and so on.\n\nThe following commands are available in your CLI\n\nCreating a new project\n\nThe lyte new command creates a new application in the sLyte framework with default sLyte folder structure. You can navigate to the required folder in your terminal, and execute the command to create a new application. And the command is\n\nlyte new <app-name>\n\nHere, the app name stands for the name of the application.\n\nLet us consider an example of creating a new sLyte application called as blog-app\n\n```javascript\nlyte new blog-app\n```\n\nThis command will create a new directory called blog-app with default files and folders such as routes,components,build.js(build configuration file) and package.json(contains all the sLyte dependencies and place a npm install to install the dependencies)\n\nCreating an app without dependencies\n\nCLI also lets you to create an application without the dependencies. To do so, execute the following code\n\n```javascript\nlyte new blog-app --skip-install\n```\n\nThis feature would lend a hand if you wish to customize your package.json file before installing the dependencies.\n\nGenerating a module\n\nThe sLyte framework gives you an option to generate any module with this command. This lyte generate command will create the required files with their basic syntaxes. You can execute the lyte generate command after navigating to your application's folder.\n\nlyte generate <module(route | component | helper | mixin | connector | serializer | schema | registry | map | subapp | service)> <name> [options]\nmodule : default lyte module such as route, component, helper, mixin, test, adapter, model and serializer.\nname : name for the module\noptions : default options given by lyte for generating module\nGenerating a route\n\nThe route plays an important role in handling the navigation. And the command to generate a route is as follows:\n\nlyte generate route <route-name> <path>\nroute-name : name of the route\npath (Optional) : path for the route.\n\nIf the path is not specified, it will be generated based on the route's name.\n\nThis command adds a route entry for the routes in router/map/map.js under the method map() and creates a route file at the location router/routes/<<route-name.js>>. You can also create additional map file.\n\nThe path of a route is always relative.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate route blog /blog/favourites\n// '/blog/favourites' is path for route 'favourites'\nlyte generate route blog /blog/favourites?review=true\n// 'favourites' route with default query params\n//Router Entry\nclass BlogAppMap extends RouterMap {\n\tmap() {\n\tthis.route(\"blog\", {\n\t\tpath: \"/blog/favourites?review=true\"\n\t});\n\t}\n}\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate route blog.create\n\n// create route is nested to blog\n//Router entry under map function\nthis.route(\"blog\", {\n\tpath: \"/blog\"\n\t}, function () {\n\tthis.route(\"create\", {\n\t\tpath: \"/create\"\n\t});\n});\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate route blog.edit edit/:editId\n// edit route is dynamic route, matches with any segment\n//Router entry\nthis.route(\"blog\", {\n\tpath: \"/blog\"\n}, function () {\n\tthis.route(\"edit\", {\n\t\tpath: \"edit/:editId\"\n\t});\n});\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate route index /\n\n// route with path '/' will be executed directly when it is hit from URL\n//Router entry\nthis.route(\"index\", {\n\tpath: '/'\n});\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate route blog.wildcard *wildcard\n// wildcard route matches with multiple segments\n//Router Entry\nthis.route(\"blog\", {\n\tpath: \"/blog\"\n}, function () {\n\n\tthis.route(\"wildcard\", {\n\t\tpath: \"*wildcard\"\n\t});\n});\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate route blog --lazy\n// Lazyroute is used when you wish to render the route after sometime\n//Router Entry\nthis.lazyroute(\"blog\", {\n\tpath: \"/blog\"\n},\n);\n```\nGenerating a component\n\nComponents plays a significant role in establishing the visual layer of an application. And the command to create it is\n\nlyte generate component <component-name> [options]\ncomponent-name : name of the component\noptions : -d\n\nTo create a component inside a folder. It should be always relative to the component's default path\n\nFollowing the norms of W3C Custom Elements, the component name must have at least one hyphen in it. This helps prevent clashes with the current or future HTML element names. Therefore, blog-post or audio-player-controls are acceptable names, whereas post or AudioPlayerControls are not.\n\nYou can create a component inside the folder and also without specifying the folder. Have a look at the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate component blogger-comp\n/* create three files under component directory\n\t\t1)components/javascript/blogger-comp.js\n\t\t2)components/templates/blogger-comp.html\n\t\t3)components/styles/blogger-comp.css\n*/\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate component blogger-comp -d blogger\n/* This command will generate the files with the folder structure\n\t\t1)components/javascript/blogger/blogger-comp.js\n\t\t2)components/templates/blogger/blogger-comp.html\n\t\t3)components/styles/blogger/blogger-comp.css\n*/\n```\nGenerating a raw component\n\nRaw Components is a sLyte web component with no bindings and lifecycle hooks and dynamic html contents.

You can also use graphql, and to specify it, use --type=\"gql\"\n\nYou can create it inside the folder and also without specifying the folder. But while creating it inside the folder It should be always relative to the connector's default path. Have a look at the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate connector bloggerList\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate connector bloggerList -d blogger /* will create the connector under data-store/connector/blogger */\n```\nGenerating a serializer\n\nA serailizer is an absolute must callback layer of the data store and the command to generate it is\n\nlyte generate serializer <serializer-name> [options]\nserializer-name : name of the serializer\noptions : -d\n\nData store, by default takes RESTSerializer as its super class. You can also use graphql, and to specify it, use --type=\"gql\"\n\nYou can create it inside the folder and also without specifying the folder. But to create a serializer inside a folder, it should be always relative to the serializer's default path. Have a look at the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate serializer bloggerList\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate serializer bloggerList -d blogger /* will create the serializer under data-store/serializers/blogger */\n```\nGenerating a helper\n\nA helper is a simple class that can be called from a template.\n\nlyte generate helper <helper-name> [options]\nhelper-name : name of the helper\noptions : -d\n\nYou can create a helper inside the folder and also without specifying the folder. But to create a helper inside a folder, it should be always relative to the helper's default path. Have a look at the below code snippet.\n\nTo generate a helper for concatenation of the string with name concatString, execute below command in the terminal\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate helper concatString\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate helper concatString  -d string\n```\n\nHyphens are not allowed to be used in helper names. When there are multiple words in the name, we can name the helper as ConcatString or PrefixString instead of using a hyphen.\n\nGenerating a mixin\n\nMixins are used to share functions across different components, routers, or data layers. Before you register a mixin, you need to generate it with the slyte generate command.\n\nlyte generate mixin <mixin-name> [options]\nmixin-name : name of the mixin\noptions : -d\n\nYou can create a mixin inside the folder and also without specifying the folder. But to create a mixin inside a folder, it should be always relative to the mixin's default path. Have a look at the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate mixin menu-util\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate mixin menu-util  -d util\n```\nGenerating a service\n\nServices are modules that can be share across the application.

But to create a srvice inside a folder, it should be always relative to the service's default path. Have a look at the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nlyte generate service request\n```\n```javascript\nlyte generate service request -d util\n```\nGenerating a registry\n\nJust like components, you can also generate a registry. On generating a registry you will get a folder which holds the components pertaining to that registry. You can find this registry in build.js. The command to create a registry is\n\nlyte generate registry registryname\nGenerating a map\n\nAdditional to the map.js file, you can also create a map file.\n\nThe command to generate a additional map file is\n\nlyte generate map mapname\n\nWhile creating an additional map, you will be asked to provide the basePath. You can provide the default route(index) or you can provide any route that you have created earlier.\n\nYou can also create a parallel route to the default route by providing '/' in the basePath.\n\nIn the case, where the map is created in prior to the route, and if you want that route to be present in the created map, you can do so by executing the below command\n\nlyte generate route routename --map mapname\n```javascript\nlyte generate route home --map map3\n```\nGenerating a subapp\n\nCreates a new subapp inside an existing sLyte application.\n\nlyte new subapp <subapp-name>[options]\noptions: -d <directory> - Create the subapp in a specific directory\n```javascript\nlyte new subapp my-subapp\nlyte new subapp my-subapp -d apps\n```\nPodApp Support\nlyte new subapp <name> --podApp\nGenerating a module in subapp\n\nAny above mentioned modules can be generated within a subapp.\n\nlyte generate module <module-name> --subApp <subapp-name>\n```javascript\nlyte g component user-profile --subApp my-subapp\nlyte generate helper auth-helper --subApp my-subapp\n```\n\nWhen creating registries in subapps, the system automatically updates the registry in the build/config.js file in subapp.\n\nPoints to remenber\nSubapps can only be created inside existing Lyte applications\nThe --subApp flag works with most generate commands (component, helper, etc.)\nSubapps are automatically registered in build.js\nGenerating Components with Registry in Subapp\n\nYou can also generate component with registry in a subapp just like a below code snippet.\n\nlyte generate component <component-name> --subApp <subapp-name> --registry <registry-name>\n```javascript\nlyte g component user-card --subApp admin-panel --registry users\nlyte generate helper data-formatter --subApp e-commerce --registry products\n```\nDestroying a module\n\nThe lyte destroy command will delete all the files and folders that was created using the lyte generate command. The syntax for using the lyte destroy command is:\n\nlyte destroy <module-name> <name> [options]\n\nFor the modules, you need to specify the module name.\n\nIf you created a module inside a folder, you are required to specify the same while destroying the folder.\n\n```javascript\nlyte destroy component blogger-comp\n/* Removes three files under component directory\n\t\t1. components/javascript/blogger-comp.js\n\t\t2. components/templates/blogger-comp.html\n\t\t3. components/styles/blogger-comp.css\n*/\n```\n```javascript\nlyte destroy component blogger-comp -d blogger\n/* This command will destroy the files with the folder structure\n\t\t1. components/javascript/blogger/blogger-comp.js\n\t\t2. components/templates/blogger/blogger-comp.html\n\t\t3. components/styles/blogger/blogger-comp.css\n*/\n```\nDestroying a route\n\nIf you need to destroy routes, you are required to specify the complete route name.\n\n```javascript\nlyte destroy route favourites\n// destroys the favourites route\n```\n```javascript\nlyte destroy route blog.create\n// create route nested to blog will be destroyed\n```\nDestroying a subapp\n\nRemoves an existing subapp and cleans up its configuration.\n\nlyte destroy subapp <subapp-name>[options]\noptions: -d <directory> - Destroy the subapp in a specific directory\nBuilding the application\n\nThe lyte build command compiles all the files and places them into the output folder. By default, the output folder is /dist. The syntax for using the lyte build command is:\n\nlyte build [options]\n```javascript\nlyte build\nlyte build --watch\nlyte build --production\n```\n--production: In production, the js files (i.e., the routes, models, components, etc.) will be concatenated and minified as per the configurations provided by the user in build.js.\n-watch: The --watch option watches the files for changes and automatically builds the application.\n\nThe default value is false.\n\n'log.txt' contains logs of CLI build process.\n\nServing the application\n\nThe lyte serve command will start the application at port 3000 by default. The syntax for using the lyte serve command is:\n\nlyte serve [options]\n--port (Number) : To change the port of the lyte serve\n\nIf you want the application to be started in a different port, you can change the port number. Include --port << port number >> in your lyte serve command.\n\nTo run the application in port 4000 you can use --port options\n\n```javascript\nlyte serve --port=4000\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

You can also write a custom function to be executed before and after build process. The custom function which has to be executed before the build process must be specified before the init and the custom function that has to be executed after the build process must be specified after the build.\n\n```javascript\nbuild : async function (options)  {\n    buildUtils = require(path.join(options.cliRoot,'lib','utilities','buildUtils'));\n    /* Building of modules starts. Custom modules can be added in build function.*/\n    await buildUtils.init(options); /* Provides options to buildUtils.*/\n    await buildUtils.build(options);\n},\n```\nDefault build procedures\n\nBy default, CLI incorporates the routes and components. If your application has any helpers, mixers or any files that has to taken into consideration while building, you can mention it in build.js. Now let us see what happens while building the routes and components.\n\nBuilding routes:\n\nThe routes that has been mentioned in map.js gets imported and gets compiled automatically.\n\nBuilding components:\n\nWhile building the components, CLI bundles the template files, style files and the JS files into a single JS file. Based on your requirements, CLI gives you an option to bundle the CSS files along the the JS files. You can set the property 'includeStyle: true' to bundle it and set the property 'includeStyle: false' to consider not bundling the CSS and the JS files.\n\n```javascript\nincludeStyle : true /* toggle this boolean to include style into component's javascript file */\n```\n\nRather than bundling the CSS file, you can also use the link tag just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nincludeLinkTag=true;\n```\n\nOn doing so, the css file will be added as a link tag to the JS file. And now in the dist folder you can see the JS and the CSS file.\n\n```javascript\nisBaseHref=true;\n```\n\nOn setting isBaseHref true, the leading forward slash (/) is removed from absolute paths to support <base> tag in HTML.\n\nLet us see an example with and without isBaseHref\n\n```javascript\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles/main.css\">>\n```\n```javascript\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles/main.css\">\n```\nWatching for file changes\n\nA Watcher watches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions of files and directories. Changes in components, routes, models, and configuration JSON files are watched, and they are built once again if changes occur. You can also write custom watcher function to watch the files. And that particular file, requiring watcher function must require sane in build.js. Have a look at the below code to see how the custom watcher function works.\n\nobj (object)\npath (String) path of the directory to watch\nignored (optional) (Array) a glob, regex, or file path to ignore from watching\nglob (optional) (Array) a single string glob pattern to watch\n```javascript\nvar obj = {\n    path : options.root ,\n    ignored : [\n        '/bower_components/' ,\n        '/node-modules/'\n    ] ,\n    glob : [ '**/*.css' , '**/*.js' ]\n}\nvar sane=require('sane');\n/* sane is the npm package for watching the files */\nvar watcher = sane ( obj.path , {\n    glob : obj.glob ,\n    ignored : obj.ignored\n} ) ;\nwatcher.on ( 'change' , function ( filePath , root , stat ) {\n    /* code to execute when the file changes */\n} ) ;\nwatcher.on ( 'add' , function ( filePath , root , stat ) {\n    /* code to execute when the file new added */\n} ) ;\nwatcher.on ( 'delete' , function ( filePath , root , stat ) {\n    /* code to execute when the file deleted */\n} ) ;\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

Keep reading to know more about it.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport { Lyte } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport  {studentAppDb} from \"./data-store/schemas/test.js;  //@dependencies\nimport  {studentAppComponentRegistry}  from \"./components/javascript/ab-comp.js\";  //@resources\nimport \"/plugins/testPlugin.js\" //@bundle\nclass RouteFile extends Route {\n  // ... your route component logic ...\n}\n```\nBlock Comments\n\nYou can @mention multiple lines of import with its file type. All you need to do is mention the multiple lines of imports with the //#startresources and //#end resorces. Have a look at the below code snippet to see how it works.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\n //#start resources\nimport \"f.js\" ;\nimport \"h.js\" ;\nimport \"i.js\" ;\n//#end resources\nclass RouteFile extends Route {\n // ... your route component logic ...\n }\n```\n\nApart from the block comments, you can also provide @mention even for a single line of imports just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport \"m.js\" ;//@bundle\nclass RouteFile extends Route {\n  // ... your route component logic ...\n}\n```\nConditionals\nIf check in block comments\n\nYou can use 'if' condition in the import statement. And if the 'if condition' returns true, then the particular file gets imported along with other files to import. And if the 'if condition' returns false, apart from that particular import statement all other import statement gets executed.\n\n```html\nimport \"a.js\" ; //@bundle\nimport \"b.js\" ; //@resources\nimport \"c.js\" ; //@dependencies\nimport \"d.js\" ; //@resources @ if a<b\nimport \"e.js\" ; //@if b<c @ dependencies\n```\n```javascript\n//#start resources\nimport \"f.js\" ;\nimport \"h.js\" ;\nimport \"i.js\" ;\n//#end resources\n```\n```javascript\n//#start dependencies\nimport \"l.js\" ; //@ if b<c\nimport \"j.js\" ;\nimport \"k.js\" ;\n//#end dependencies\n```\n```javascript\nimport \"m.js\" ;\nimport \"g.js\";\n//#start if c<d\nimport \"m.js\" ;\nimport \"g.js\";\n//#end if\n```\n\nIf the file type of a single line differs from the rest of other lines in the import statements, even in such cases based on the given comments, the files gets imported.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\n//#start dependencies\nimport \"a.js\" ; //@bundle\nimport \"b.js\" ; //@resources\nimport \"c.js\" ; //@dependencies\nimport \"d.js\" ; //@resources @ if a<b\nimport \"e.js\" ; //@if b<c @ dependencies\n//#end dependencies\nclass RouteFile extends Route {\n  // ... your route component logic ...\n}\n```\nDownload initiators\n\nThe available file types are\n\n//@resources\n//@dependencies\n//@bundle\n//@dist\n//@resources\n\nYou can import the files which are required for the execution of route during the data fetch or permission check and mention it as resources. You can mention it as '@resources' or '@getResources'.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport \"a.js\" ; //@resources\nimport \"a.js\" ; //@getResources\nclass RouteFile extends Route {\n  // ... your route component logic ...\n}\n```\n//@dependencies\n\nYou can import the files which are required only during rendering, post rendering and mention it as dependencies. You can mention it as '@dependencies' or '@getdependencies'.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport \"b.js\" ; //@dependencies\nimport \"b.js\" ; //@getDependencies\nclass RouteFile extends Route {\n  // ... your route component logic ...\n}\n```\n//@bundle\n\nAny files that you wish to bundle it along the route can be specified as bundle in the imports.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport \"/plugins/testPlugin.js\" //@bundle\nclass RouteFile extends Route {\n  // ... your route component logic ...\n}\n```\n//@dist\n\nWith the help of '@dist', you can import the files which are only available in the dist folder.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport \"/a.css\"; //@dist\nclass RouteFile extends Route {\n  // ... your route component logic ...\n}\n```\nOverride\n\nWhile using the import statements, if the file type is not mentionted, then by default CLI imports the file based on the its type. CLI also provides an additional favour for you, that is, you can also overide the files as dependencies and resources, even if they don't fall under that category. Have a look at the below code to get a better understanding of it.\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport { Lyte } from \"@slyte/core\";\nimport  {studentAppDb} from \"./data-store/schemas/test.js;  //@resources\nimport  {studentAppComponentRegistry}  from \"./components/javascript/ab-comp.js\";  //@dependencies\nclass RouteFile extends Route {\n  // ... your route component logic ...\n}\n```\nDynamic CSS theme Loading\n\nCSS files in your application can be dynamically imported using placeholders within the import path. This allows flexible styling based on user preferences or application state.\n\n```javascript\nimport \"/css/styles/$key1/$key2/.../a.css\n```\n\n$key1 and $key2 are placeholders that will be replaced with actual values during the build process. These variables are user-defined and can represent various attributes, such as theme, direction, lang, etc\n\nDefining Dynamic Variables\n\nDynamic variables are defined in build.js as follows\n\n```javascript\ndynamicVars = {\n    key1: [\"ltr\", \"rtl\"],\n    key2: [\"light\", \"dark\"]\n};\n```\n\nLet us see an example\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  version: \"1.0.0-RC\",\n  setCustomConfiguration: function (options) {\n      options.customConfig = {\n      outputFolder: \"dist\",\n        dynamicVars: {\n          dir: [\"ltr\", \"rtl\"], // Possible values for 'dir'\n          theme: [\"light\", \"dark\"] // Possible values for 'theme'\n        },\n      }\n  }\n}\n```\nRuntime Configuration\n\nThe env object in app.js determines the active combination of dynamic variables during runtime in app.js. This combination has to be mentioned in app.js. Here's how you configure it\n\n```javascript\nenv = {\n  key1: \"ltr\",\n  key2: \"dark\"\n};\n```\n\nLet us see an example of it.\n\n```javascript\nclass SampleApp extends Lyte {\n  env = {\n      dir: \"ltr\", // Currently using left-to-right direction\n      theme: \"dark\"// Currently using the dark theme\n  };\n}\n```\n\nWhen the values within the env object are updated, the application will dynamically switch to the corresponding CSS file.\n\nLet us see an example usage in a Route\n\n```javascript\nimport { Route } from \"@slyte/router\";\nimport { WelcomeComp } from \"../../components/javascript/welcome-comp\";\nimport \"/css/$dir/$theme/a.css\"; // Dynamic import based on 'dir' and 'theme'\n\nclass Index extends Route {\n    // ... your route component logic ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, if env.dir is \"ltr\" and env.theme is \"dark\", the imported CSS file will effectively be in /css/ltr/dark/a.css\n\n@dist with Dynamic Theme Loading\n\nYou can combine @dist with dynamic theme loading to import CSS files from your dist folder based on your dynamic variables.\n\nLet's say you have the below structure your dist folder. In such case, you can then use the following import statement in your index.js just like the code.\n\n```javascript\ndist/\n├── css/\n│   ├── ltr/\n│   │   ├── dark/\n│   │   │   └── a.css\n│   │   └── light/\n│   │        └── a.css\n│   └── rtl/\n│       ├── dark/\n│       │   └── a.css\n│       └── light/\n│           └── a.css\n└── ... other files ...\n```\n```javascript\nimport \"/css/$dir/$theme/a.css\"; //@dist\n```\n\nNow, when your application runs, the build process will replace $dir and $theme with the values from your env object. The @dist directive will ensure that the resulting path is resolved relative to your dist folder.\n\nLet us see some example scenario\n\nenv.dir = \"ltr\", env.theme = \"dark\": Here, the import will resolve to dist/css/ltr/dark/a.css.\n\nenv.dir = \"rtl\", env.theme = \"light\": Here, the import will resolve to dist/css/rtl/light/a.css.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 197,
    "content": "Theme Configuration\nConfiguring the themes\nConfigure the folder structure for the themes:\n\nLyte-cli will search the themes files from the base path mentioned in the folder object of the configureFolders function under the key themes. By default we will considered the base path for the themes as css folder.\n\nBase path will be relative to the application\n\n```javascript\nsetCustomConfiguration : function ( options ) {\n  var folders  = {  /* Available modules and its folder structures.*/\n    routes  : 'routes' ,\n    components  : 'components' ,\n    adapters  : path.join ( 'data-store' , 'adapters' ) ,\n    models  : path.join ( 'data-store' , 'models' ) ,\n    themes : path.join ( \"css\" )\n  } ;\n}\n```\n\nThere will be two ways for compiling the themes and depending on that the configuration varies as\n\nDefault compilation\nCustom compilation\nDefault compilation\n\nDefault compilation of the themes will execute during the lyte build process. To enable default compilation of the themes follow the following steps:\n\nSet the theming options to true\n\nSet the theming options to true in the configurefolder function of the configuration file(build/build.js)\n\n```javascript\nsetCustomConfiguration: function(options) {\n   options.theming = true;\n }\n```\n\nThis configuration will also help to generate the themes file for the components during the generation of the component file.\n\nAdd the configuration file less-min-conf.json under build directory of your application\n\nsLyte supports theming based on Less(.less) library. The less files will be compiled with the help of the less compiler and the corresponding css file will be generated based on this configuration file(less-min-conf.json) and placed under the output folder of the themes.\n\n```javascript\n/* build/less-min-conf.json */ {\n   \"lyte-ui-accordion.css\" : [ \"styles/global.less\" , \"styles/accordion.less\" ] ,\n   \"lyte-ui-alert.css\" : [ \"styles/global.less\" , \"styles/alert.less\" ]\n }\n```\nTo pass the dynamic values\n\nTo pass the dynamic values for the variables defined in the less file. You can use the options named themeOptions.\n\n```javascript\noptions.themeOptions  : {\nglobalVars  : {\n  themeName  : \"night\"\n    /* themeName will be dynamicParam of the theme file */\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo compile the themes based on custom configuration Lyte-cli comes with the util to compile themes named as compileThemes. We will see how to do that in custom compilation topic.\n\nCustom compilation\n\nLyte-cli will provide an separate util for the compilation of themes. Developers can use this util for compiling multiple themes by varying value for the arguments of the utils function. This util will also compile the themes based on Less compiler.\n\nDisable the theme options\n\nFor custom compilation, disable the theming options in the build function of the build.js file to false to avoid the default less compilation\n\n```javascript\nbuild : function()  {\n  options.theming = true;\n}\n```\nAdd the compileThemes util\n\nAdd the compileThemes util after the init call of the build function of the build/build.js file.\n\n```javascript\nawait buildUtils.init(options);\nawait buildUtils.compileThemes ( {\n  src : Array of source files ,\n  dist : destination file ,\n  themeOptions : {\n\n  }\n} )\n```\n```javascript\noptions.theming = false ; /* to disable the default less compilation */\nbuildUtils.compileThemes ( {\n  src : [ \"styles/blog-list.less\" , \"styles/blog-model.less\" ] ,\n  dist : \"blog-list.css\" ,\n  themeOptions : {\n    globalVars : {\n      themeName : \"night\"\n      /* themeName will be dynamicParam of the theme file */ }\n    }\n  } )\n```\nEnable the watch for custom themes\n\nBy default, we don't provide watch for themes when compiled using compileThemes utils. You can enable this by adding options.theming = true after the call of buildUtils.build in the build function.\n\n```javascript\nbuild : async function ( options , dependencies ) {\n  /* Building of modules starts. Custom modules can be added in build function.*/\n  await buildUtils.init ( options ) ;\n  /* custom function to execute before the build process */\n  await buildUtils.build ( [ 'copyAppDir' , 'routes' , 'components' , 'models' , 'helpers' , 'mixins' ] ) ;\n  /* custom function to execute after the build process */\n  options.theming = true\n}\n```\nIncluding SCSS file\n\nCLI extends its support to include scss files instead of css files. To do so, add the below code in your build.js\n\n```javascript\noptions.cssType = \"scss\"\n```\n\nThen, execute the following command in your terminal to install the sass package.\n\n```javascript\nnpm i @zoho/lyte-cli-sass@2.0.8 --registry http://cm-npmregistry\n```\n\nAfter including it in your build.js, now when you generate a component, you can see the scss file, instead of your css file just like the below image.\n\nAnd during the build process, SCSS will be supported and converted to css in the dist folder.\n\nSimilary, when you destroy the created component, the scss files gets deleted automatically.\n\nBuilding SASS file\n\nLyte-CLI provides a separate utility for the compilation of SASS. Developers can use this utility to compile multiple themes by varying values for the arguments of the utility function. This utility also compiles themes based on the Less compiler.\n\nInstall the following package\n\n```javascript\nnpm i @zoho/lyte-cli-sass@2.0.8 --registry http://cm-npmregistry\n```\n\nAdd the following code snippet in build.js below buildUtils.init()\n\n```javascript\nlet sass = require(\"@zoho/lyte-cli-sass\"),\nawait sass.compileFolder(path.join(options.root, \"scss\")\n   /*folder to run the sass compilation*/,\noptions,\n{\noutputPath: path.join(buildOptions.outputFolder, \"scss\"),\n   /*output path for the compiled css */\nwatch: options.watch,\nfolderToWatch: path.join(options.root, \"scss\")\n   /*Folder you want to watch */\n\n});\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 199,
    "content": "Finger Prints\nIntroduction\n\nWith CLI you can achieve fingerprinting. But what actually is fingerprinting?.\n\nIn general, when a user tries to access a webpage, it hits the server and fetches the details from it and gives you the needed information.\n\nWith fingerprint, a hash value is randomly generated for each file. This hash value gets attached to the filename. Only when the hash value changes, the files gets downloaded from the server and gives you needed details. If the hash value is not changed, the cached file will be available in the browser.\n\nFingerprints in CLI\n\nDuring lyte build in the production mode, by default CLI will generate the fingerprint for all the minified files. You can find the fingerprint.js file under your outputFolder which contain the fingerprint related utils and fingerprint info of the each files. \n\nBy default, fingerprint is available in the production mode. You can enable and disable fingerprint by setting the field, options.fingePrint available in your build.js\n\noptions.fingerPrint = true/false\n```javascript\nsetCustomConfiguration : function(options) {\n    options.customConfig = {\n        outputFolder : \"dist\",\n        eslint : false,\n        fingerPrint : false\n    }\n}\n```\nRenaming fingerprint.js\n\nTo overcome the issues caused by adblockers being actively prevailing in certain browsers, the CLI allows you to rename fingerprint.js file by executing the following code.\n\n```javascript\nsetCustomConfiguration : function(options) {\n    options.customConfig = {\n        outputFolder : \"dist\",\n        eslint : false,\n        fingerPrint : true,\n       fingerPrintFileName : \"hashMap.js\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere, you set the fingerPrint as true and rename the fingerprint.js file as \"hashMap\". You can rename figureprint.js by configuring build.js.\n\nfingerPrintFileName : 'filename'\nDisabling hash for fingerprints\n\nBy default, the hash gets generated for the fingerprint file . To ignore it, use 'ignoreFingerPrintHash' as true in build.js\n\n```javascript\nsetCustomConfiguration : function(options) {\n    options.customConfig = {\n        outputFolder : \"dist\",\n        eslint : false,\n        fingerPrint : false,\n        ignoreFingerPrintHash:true\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOn doing so, hashing for fingerPrint file will be disabled.\n\nGet Fingerprints\n\nTo get the fingerprint of the particular file, you need to intially load the fingerprint.js file to the client and execute the following command\n\nLyteFingerPrint.get(<<fileName>>)\n\nThe expected return value is string.\n\nHere is an example for your reference.\n\nLyteFingerPrint.get('app.js')\nskip FingerPrints\n\nIn Build.js you can specify options.skipTheFingerPrint which is a array that allows you to specify files, directories, or patterns for which fingerprinting should be skipped, even when fingerprinting is enabled. This array can contain file paths,glob patterns, regular expressions.\n\nFile Paths: Exact paths to specific files.\n\nGlob Patterns: Patterns using wildcards (*, ?, etc.) to match multiple files or directories. .\n\nRegular Expressions: For more complex and precise matching using regular expression syntax.\n\nIf a file's path matches any entry (file path, glob pattern, or regular expression) in the options.skipTheFingerPrint array, fingerprinting will be bypassed for that file.\n\nLet us see an example.\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = {\n  setCustomConfiguration: function (options) {\n      options.customConfig = {\n        skipTheFingerPrint: [\n        \"legacy-code.js\", // Specific file\n        \"temp-folder/\", // folder path\n        \"temp-data/*\", // Glob pattern\n         /\\.map$/\\ // Regular expression\n        ],\n      };\n  }\n},\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

In this component, you will find templates, scripts, and styles grouped together in a folder with the component's name. You can observe that helpers are enclosed within the pod component.\n\nGenerate Pod component\n\nTo create a pod app, use the following command. With this command you would be able to generate a pod app with welcome component.\n\n```javascript\nslyte new <appName> --podApp\n```\n\nApart from the welcome component, you can also create your own component with the following command.\n\n```javascript\nslyte generate component <componentName> [options]\n```\n\nHere, options are as follows,\n-d [folder] : To create a component inside a folder. It should always be relative to the component's default path.\n\nCreating a component inside Pod component\n\nIf you wish to create a component inside pod component, then in such cases use the following option with the slyte generate command\n\n```javascript\nslyte generate component <componentName> [options]\n```\n\nHere, options are as follows,\n-p [podName] : In podApp, a pod-component can have another pod-component within its range. To indicate which pod-component is referred, the produced component should be enclosed with the -p flag.\n-d [folder] : To create a component inside a folder. It should always be relative to the component's default path.\n\nDestroying Pod component\n\nTo destroy a pod component, use the following command.

Lyte-cli will figure out which other modules and libraries that entry point depends on (directly and indirectly). In simple words, the CLI begins its bundling with the files given in the entry points.\n\nOn creating a app, you would see lyte.config.js file just like the below code snippet.\n\nOn clicking it, you can find the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nlet path = require(\"path\");\nmodule.exports = function() {\n    return {\n        initialFileToLoad : path.join(process.cwd(),\"app-init.js\"),\n        entry:{}\n    }}\n```\nAdding a file\n\nAll you need to do is just provide the name of the file from which you desire the bundling to get started just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nentry : {\n    \"app-bundle\" : \"./app.js\"\n}\n```\n\nHere, the bundling starts from the file 'app.js'.\n\nYou can mention the entry point file as an array or as an object. If you are passing additional parameters to it, it is permissible to mention it only as an object.\n\nAdditional parameters\n\nThe additional parameters can be passed as an object along with the entry file just like the below code snippet. Keep reading to know about the additional parameters.\n\n```javascript\nentry : {\n   \"app-bundle\" : {\n       import : \"./app.js\" ,\n       runStandalone : true ,\n       layoutHTML : \"app.html\"\n       chunk : ['components/javascript/welcome-comp']\n       dependsOn: [components/homepage.js]\n   },\n   \"components/javascript/welcome-comp\" : [\"./components/javascript/welcome-comp.js\",\"components/javascript/welcome-page.js\"]\n   }\n```\n\nImport: Mention the file name or the module that is to be loaded.\n\nrunStandalone: This parameter being a boolean, on setting true, if the entry points doesn't depend on each other, in such case, all common chunks are bundled along with the entry points. And on setting as false, if the entry points doesn't depend on each other, the common chunks are bundled separately.\n\nlayoutHTML: With this you can provide the layout html for the entry point.\n\nchunk: Here, you can provide the Array of other entry points to be included in this page\n\ndependsOn: Here, you can provide the files upon which the entry point file is dependent on. On setting this parameter, only after the download of the dependent file, the entry point file will be downloaded and executed.\n\nmaxSize\n\nWith this param, you communicate to the webpack stating to split the files as chunks if the file size exceeds the threshold. The threshold is set with the parameter maxSize in bytes. Have a look at the below code snippet.\n\nWhen the file splitting becomes unwieldy below a certain threshold, utilize `slyte-import` to import dependencies for an entry point.\n\n```javascript\noptimization:{\n   splitChunks:{\n       maxSize: 10 /*Value in Bytes*/\n    }\n }\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Internationalization\n\nSome of the UI components require i18n files to work. The default text provided by the UI components can be internationalized by importing the i18n files of the language currently being used in the website.\n\nOnly the text used by UI components by default can be internationalized. It should be noted that if you are using your own text in UI components, such texts can't be internationalized.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button>\n   <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n     Perform An Action\n   </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n\nIn the above example the \"Perform an action\" does not get internationalized. It is the job of the developer to internationalize it. On the other hand, the month names rendered in lyte-calendar do get internationalized because they are the default part of UI components.\n\nComponents requiring i18n are:\n\nlyte-calendar\nlyte-dropdown\nlyte-daterangepicker\nlyte-colorpicker\nlyte-dragdrop\nlyte-input\n\nThe following languages are supported by UI components.\n\nBulgarian\tChinese\tChinese-Taiwan\tCroatian\tCzech\nDanish\tEnglish-UK\tEnglish-US\tFrench\tGerman\nHungarian\tItalian\tJapanese\tHebrew\tHindi\nNetherlands\tPolish\tPortuguese-brazil\tPortuguese-portugal\tKorean\nRussian\tSpanish\tSwedish\tTurkish\tVietnamese\n\nInclude the following dependencies\n\n```html\n<!-- i18n files -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/I18n\" />\n<!-- files end-->\n```\n\nWhen you are changing the language in your application make sure to import the appropriate i18n file for the UI components as well. The i18n file is in the form of JSON, so bringing in a different language file replaces the old one.\n\nFor example: Lets say initially, the website renders in English and the en_US.js file is loaded for UI components. Later on, when the user switches from English to French, simply bringing in the fr_FR.js file will change the language of UI components.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Things To know\nProperties and Configuration\n\nProperties in UI Components are prefixed with lt-prop. For example, the value property in a radiobutton is lt-prop-value. Here's how you pass properties to UI components.\n\n```html\n<lyte-radiobutton lt-prop-name=\"radio-group\" lt-prop-value=\"shipping\" lt-prop-label=\"Shipping\"></lyte-radiobutton>\n```\n\nYou can also get and set lt-prop attributes in UI Components through your javascript. You need to querySelect your component and invoke the .ltProp() function on them.\n\nThis demonstrates a getter function.\n\n```javascript\nvar value = document.querySelector('lyte-radiobutton').ltProp('value');\n```\n\nThis demonstrates a setter function.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector('lyte-radiobutton').ltProp('value' , 'COD');\n```\nCallbacks\n\nUI Components provides callbacks for you to work with. They are usually invoked in response to an action performed on a component. These callbacks depends on the method behaviour of the sLyte component. For example, the 'on-before-checked' callback of a checkbox is invoked everytime when a checkbox moves to before checked state.\n\nYou can also use the callback to set data, make a XMLHttpRequest, trigger an animation, etc. Apart from that there are many other callbacks to make your process easier. This callback is usually written in the js file of the component inside which you have invoked the UI Component. For example, if you have used lyte-checkbox in your welcome-comp.html then the definition of the callback is written in the welcome-comp.js file. Here's an example.\n\n```html\n<lyte-checkbox on-checked={{method(\"makeRequest\")}} lt-prop-appearance=\"failure\"></lyte-checkbox>\n```\n```javascript\nimport { Component } from \"@slyte/component\";\nclass UserComp extends Component {\nconstructor() {\n    super();\n}\ndata() {\n    return {\n\n    }\n}\nstatic methods() {\n    return{\n        makeRequest : function(){\n            // Make a request\n        }\n    }\n }\n}\nexport { UserComp };\n```\n\nIn the cases were the methods could not be statically defined in the conponent's js, you can use the .setMethods() to register callbacks dynamically.\n\n```javascript\ndocument.querySelector( 'lyte-checkbox' ).setMethods({\n    onChecked : function(){\n        // Do stuff\n    }\n});\n```\n\nDevelopers generally use .setMethods() when they are not using slyte's templating system or when they have rendered the component through script( registry.render or document.createElement to create the component).\n\nAs you can tell, the callbacks in UI Components are methods. To get an elaborate overview of methods, visit the following link.\n\nYield\n\nBy far, Yield is the most important concept of UI Components. It is highly recommended to learn about yield before trying to use UI Component's yield.\n\nHere's a quick overview of what it is. Suppose you want to create a button component for your app. Now on taking a note on the visual for buttons in your app, you find that there are 15 variations of buttons in all. Now, you as a developer, need to come up with a way to create a button component that encompasses all these 15 variations.\n\nOne way to do it is to create a type attribute in your button component and based on the value of the type you render different buttons by making use of a switch. This doesn't help because new buttons types will come further down the road and this forces you to keep increasing the size of your button component. In the end, you ship a massive button component at the start of your app and most of the button types might be used in some corner of the website which the user might not even visit.\n\nIn such cases, you can create a button component just to cover the cases that occurs the most and achieve other customizations through yield. In the above example, you achieve the first 4 types by making use of a type attribute and you achieve the icon types through yield. Here's a definition of your button component.\n\n```html\n<template tag-name=\"button-comp\">\n    <% if( type == 'default' ){ %>\n        <button class=\"default\">\n            {{content}}\n        </button>\n    <% }elseif(type=='primary'){ %>\n        <button class=\"primary\">\n            {{content}}\n        </button>\n    <% } else if( type == 'success' ){ %>\n        <button class=\"success\">\n            {{content}}\n        </button>\n    <% } else if( type == 'success-outlined' ){ %>\n        <button class=\"success-outlined\">\n            {{content}}\n        </button>\n    <% } else if( type == 'yield' ) { %>\n        <button class={{classVal}} style={{styleVal}}>\n            <lyte-yield yield-name=\"yield\"> </lyte-yield>\n        </button>\n    <% } %>\n</template>\n```\n\nTo create the archive button using yield, you would invoke the component as follows.\n\n```html\n<button-comp type='yield' style-val='background-color: black;'>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <i class=\"mR3 fas fa-archive\"> </i>\n        <span class=\"borderLeft\"> Archive </span>\n    </template>\n</button-comp>\n```\n\nWhen the button-comp is invoked as above, the content inside the template tag in the invocation is appended to the lyte-yield tag in the button-comp.html file and rendered. With the style-val attribute set to background-color black, you can achieve an archive button.\n\nThe yield is at the core of most UI Components. Most UI Components define a skeletal outer layer and allows you to input your own DOM content into it. The lyte-modal allows you to add DOM content to its body, the lyte-button allows you to add content to a button's innerHTML, etc.\n\nHere's a simple example of a lyte-calender using an yield. The lyte-calendar renders a calendar widget, but also allows you to add your own DOM content to its footer. Here's how its achieved.\n\n```html\n<lyte-calendar>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"footer\">\n        <div style=\"padding: 5px 0px 5px 15px;\">\n            <a> Day </a>\n            <a> Week </a>\n            <a> Month </a>\n        </div>\n    </template>\n</lyte-calendar>\n```\n\nRemember you can add your own DOM elements, styles and bind functions to the yielded content. Here's an example demonstrating binding a function to the lyte-dropdown's header tag.\n\n```html\n<lyte-dropdown>\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"yield\">\n        <lyte-drop-box>\n            <lyte-drop-header>\n                <span class=\"content\" onclick={{action('doStuff')}}>\n                    Add More\n                </span>\n            </lyte-drop-header>\n            <lyte-drop-body>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='1'> Option 1 </lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='2'> Option 2 </lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='3'> Option 3 </lyte-drop-item>\n                <lyte-drop-item data-value='4'> Option 4 </lyte-drop-item>\n            </lyte-drop-body>\n        </lyte-drop-box>\n    </template>\n</lyte-dropdown>\n```\n```javascript\nstatic actions() {\n    return{\n       doStuff : function(){\n          // Make a request\n       }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, everything inside the yield is the container which opens when a dropdown is clicked. An action is bound to the header and it can be handled in the parent component.\n\nThemeing\n\nThe themeing module in UI Components uses the Less framework. The css is defined as variables or as mixins. sLyte application can customize the Less variables or mixins to make the UI component's visual to sync with your app's visual. More on themeing over here.\n\nSome of the UI components require i18n files to work. The default text provided by the UI components can be internationalized by importing the i18n files of the language currently being used in the website. It is also important to note that Only the text used by UI components by default can be internationalized. It should be noted that if you are using your own text in UI components, such texts can't be internationalized. You can learn more about Internationalization here\n\nNow let's navigate to learn about how to work with the UI components in general.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

This will help you understand some of the attributes associated with the UI Components and also give you an idea about what CSS rule to change when you want to style the component according to your needs.\n\nChanging CSS\n\nAlmost all the time, people using UI Components would want to style the components in a way that fits their app. There are a number of ways to style UI Components in sLyte and let us have a look at them.\n\nLets take the example of lyte-button, which requires the border-radius of lyte-button to be 3px. This is how we would do it.\n\nFirst inspect lyte-button and find out which style is being applied for the border-radius property of the button element rendered inside. In our case, it is the following style.\n\n```css\nlyte-button button {\n    border-radius: 2px;\n    font-size: 15px;\n    padding: 5px 15px;\n    font-family: 'LatoRegular', 'Open Sans', sans-serif;\n    display: inline-block;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    cursor: pointer;\n    outline: none;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    border-style: solid;\n}\n```\n\nThe above style can be found inside the dist/node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-button.css\n\nTo change the border-radius of the button, just use the same CSS rule and add your new border radius.\n\n```css\nlyte-button button {\n    border-radius: 3px;\n}\n```\n\nNow this style will be contained in another CSS file. Just make sure this file is loaded after the ui-components/themes/compiledCSS/default/ltr/lyte-ui-button.css file. Since the browser follows source order when deciding the styles for an element, the style added last(which is the new style we created) will be used as the border-radius for the button.\n\nAnother way to change the style of the button is by writing styles with more specific CSS selectors. In the example above, we could add a class to the lyte button element and write a CSS rule based on that class.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button class=\"some-class\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        Secondary\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n```css\n.some-class button {\n    border-radius: 3px;\n}\n```\n\nA third way to do this is using UI Components themeing system. This will be explained in the Themes section.\n\nSetting Attributes\n\nYou can set the usual HTML attributes on UI Components that you would normally set on other HTML elements.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button id=\"someid\" lt-prop-appearance=\"secondary\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        Secondary\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n\nYou can later query these elements in your javascript code as follows.\n\n```javascript\nvar button = document.querySelector( '#someid' );\n```\nCommon Utils\n\nA common utility function that is available on all UI Components is the .ltProp() function. You can use this function to either get or set an attribute as follows. To use this util, you need a reference to the component element.\n\n```html\n<lyte-button id=\"someid\" lt-prop-appearance=\"failure\">\n    <template is=\"registerYield\" yield-name=\"text\">\n        Failure\n    </template>\n</lyte-button>\n```\n\nFor the above button, you can get or set the lt-prop-background-color attribute using .ltProp() function as follows.\n\n```javascript\nvar button = document.getElementById( 'someid' );\nvar color = button.ltProp( 'backgroundColor' ); // Getter\nbutton.ltProp( 'backgroundColor', 'red' ); // Setter\n```\n\nIt can be seen that the background-color is passed in the camel case form: backgroundColor\n\nRegistering Defaults\n\nLets say, your team decides that every lyte-button rendered in your app must render as a primary button. One way to do this is to pass the lt-prop-apperance attribute of the button as primary. While this can be done, developers might sometimes find themselves missing the attribute. In complex examples where 4-5 attributes have to be passed, then it could lead to inconsistencies in the UI.\n\nA way around this is to use the registerDefaultValues util. The example below demonstrates the use of registerDefaultValues on lyte-button.\n\n```javascript\n_lyteUiUtils.registerDefaultValues( {\n    'lyte-button': {\n    'size': 'large',\n    'backgroundColor': 'red',\n    'appearance': 'primary'\n    }\n} );\n```\n\nNow lyte-buttons rendered by default will have lt-prop-size as large, lt-prop-background-color as red and lt-prop-type as primary.\n\nSprites\n\nUI Components uses a sprite file to display icons in some of the components. The sprite file can be found under the node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/theme/images/ folder and is used in CSS properties like background-image. Make sure the path used in the CSS points to location of the sprite resource.\n\nLet's navigate to learn about the popular callbacks\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Popular Callbacks\nonShow or onOpen\n\nonShow or onOpen is popular callback,being widely used across many UI Components. This callback comes into picture when a component shows or opens. One popular UI Component that uses onShow callback is modal.\n\nonHide or onClose\n\nonHide or onClose callback, plays a vital role in dropDown component. This callback gets executed when a component hides or closes.\n\nonSelect or onChanged\n\nonSelect or onChanged, runs when a value in a menu or dropdown is selected or when a checkbox or radio button is changed or a nav item is selected.\n\nBefore Callback\n\nYou will find that some of the UI Components in sLyte will have a callback which is prefixed with on-before or before. You can return false from these callbacks to prevent the component from completing an action it would otherwise normally complete.\n\nReturning false from on-before-open in accordion will prevent the accordion from opening.\n\n```javascript\nstatic methods() {\n     onBeforeOpen: function() {\n         return false; // prevents accordion from opening.\n     }\n}\n```\n\nLet's navigate to learn about layouts.\n\nPrevious\nNext\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "content": "Text\nIntroduction\n\nLyte-text, from the family of UI components, is used to show tooltip when the text content exceeds its container width. Lyte-text uses lyte-tooltip for showing tooltip.\n\nDependencies\n```html\n<!-- Individual css files -->\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/css-variables/ltr/lyte-ui-text.css\"> </link>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/css-variables/ltr/lyte-ui-tooltip.css\"> </link>\n\n// For array of strings displaying\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/css-variables/ltr/lyte-ui-popover.css\"> </link>\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/@zoho/lyte-ui-component/dist/themes/compiledCSS/css-variables/ltr/lyte-ui-hovercard.css\"> </link>\n```\n\nThe input content can be a string or an array of strings\n\nString\nText overflow\n\nLyte-text will check its content on mouseenter and sets title for lyte-text tag if its content exceeds its container.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-value = \"Showing long text using lyte-text\"> </lyte-text>\n```\nTooltip properties\n\nYou can directly set lt-prop-tooltip-config to lyte-text.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-value = \"Showing long text using lyte-text\" lt-prop-tooltip-config = '{ \"position\" : \"bottom\" }'> </lyte-text>\n```\nPrevent tooltip\n\nYou can prevent tooltip show even when text overflow ellipsis is applied to lyte-text by setting lt-prop-show as false.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-value = \"Showing long text using lyte-text\" lt-prop-show = false> </lyte-text>\n```\nYielded text\n\nYou can provide yield to lyte-text by setting lt-prop-yield as true.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-yield = true lt-prop-value = \"Showing long text using lyte-text\">\n<template is = \"registerYield\" yield-name = \"lyte-text\">\n    <span> Showing long text using lyte-text  </span>\n</template>\n</lyte-text>\n```\nArray of strings\nDisplaying array of strings\n\nIn this you can render array of strings with lt-prop-array through lyte-text. If string contents exceeds its width remaining contents will be shown using a hovercard element.\n\nYield is not supported if array of strings is passed. By default hover card will be shown on hovering prefix element.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-array = '[\"Leads\",\"Contacts\",\"Deals\",\"Reports\",\"Mails\",\"Accounts\",\"Documents\",\"Campaigns\",\"Visits\",\"Projects\"]' style = \"width:500px\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass'&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\" lt-prop-width = 375>\n\t\t\t\t</lyte-text>\n```\nMin count\n\nIf none of the strings in the provided array is not fitting within component's available width, in such case you can display minimum number of strings by setting lt-prop-min-count\n\nDisplayed text will be shown in tooltip( when it gets hovered ) and the remaining items will be displayed in a hovercard.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-array = '[\"Some long text having Leads Contacts Deals Reports Mails\",\"Accounts\",\"Documents\",\"Campaigns\",\"Visits\",\"Projects\"]' style = \"width:300px\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass'&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\" lt-prop-min-count = 1></lyte-text>\n```\nTail text\n\nWith the tail support you can now show ellipsis at the middle of the text. Fixed tail content will be displayed after that. Regex matching the provided value will be consided as the tail text\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-tail = \"\\..+$\" lt-prop-value = \"Some long file name.png\" lt-prop-aria = true style = \"width: 150px\"></lyte-text>\n```\nFill available\n\nIn array of strings if space is available one extra content will be rendered with ellipsis even if that particular item does not fit in that space\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-fill-available = true lt-prop-array = '[ \"Long content\", \"Short content\", \"Very short content\" ]' style = \"width: 300px\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass'&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\"></lyte-text>\n```\n\nLet us also see the result where lt-prop-fill-available is declared as false.\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-fill-available = false lt-prop-array = '[ \"Long content\", \"Short content\", \"Very short content\" ]' style = \"width: 300px\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass'&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\"></lyte-text>\n```\nTag rendering\n\nIn this array of strings provided will be rendered as tags\n\n```html\n<lyte-text lt-prop-tag = true lt-prop-array = '[ \"Lead\", \"Contacts\", \"Accounts\", \"Deals\", \"Reports\", \"Mails\", \"Campaign\", \"Visits\", \"Projects\" ]' style=\"width: 400px;\" lt-prop-suffix = \" and &lt;span class ='prefixClass' tabindex = 0&gt;{0} others&lt;/span&gt;\"  lt-prop-show-hovercard-on-click = true></lyte-text>\n```\nEllipsis in non lyte-text\n\nYou can use ellipsis & hover tooltip in non lyte-text elements also. Render your text content with 'lyteTextEllipsisNode' class.\n\n```html\n<span class = \"lyteTextEllipsisNode\" style = \"width:150px\">Some long text having long value</span>\n```\nProperties\n\nAll properties should be prefixed with lt-prop.\n\nvalue\nDataType\t:\tString\nDefault\t:\t\nDescription\t:\tGiven value will be set as text content.\nshow\nDataType\t:\tBoolean\nDefault\t:\ttrue\nDescription\t:\tIf it is set to false, tooltip will not be shown even text overflow ellipsis is applied.\nyield\nDataType\t:\tBoolean\nDefault\t:\tfalse\nDescription\t:\tIf it is set to true, yielded contents will be rendered.\narray\nDataType\t:\tArray of strings\nDefault\t:\tundefined\nDescription\t:\tIf this property is given, the text that overflows from an array will be shown in a hovercard element.\nsuffix\nDataType\t:\tString\nDefault\t:\t' '\nDescription\t:\tIf the text overflows, the given suffix will be displayed along with the available text content. {0} will be replaced by hidden elements count.\nhovercard\nDataType\t:\tStringified JSON\nDefault\t:\t{}\nDescription\t:\tAll the properties of hovercard can be given as a single object.\nseparator\nDataType\t:\tString\nDefault\t:\t,\nDescription\t:\tseparator to be added while displaying array of strings.\nwidth\nDataType\t:\tString\nDefault\t:\t-\nDescription\t:\tGiven value will be considered as component width.

By default animation is set to slide from top and duration is 0.5s.\nThe options provided for animation property are -\n\nslideFromTop : By setting this value, the modal when opened, slides down from the top of the window and gets fixed to a position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property. And when closed, the modal starts sliding upwards from that position and disappears.\nslideFromBottom : By setting this value, the modal when opened, slides up from the bottom of the window and gets fixed to a position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property. Similarly when closed, the modal starts sliding downwards and disappears.\nslideFromLeft : By setting this value, the modal when opened, appears sliding from the left side of the window and gets fixed to a position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property. Similarly when closed, the modal starts sliding sidewise towards left and disappears.\nslideFromRight : By setting this value, the modal when opened, appears sliding from the right side of the window and gets fixed to a position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property.Similarly when closed, the modal starts sliding sidewise towards right and disappears.\nfadeIn : By setting this value, the modal when opened, fades in at the position provided by the user through ltPropOffset property. Similarly when closed, the modal fades out and disappears.\nzoom : By setting this value, the modal opens with zoom in animation and closes, with zoom out animation. If originElement is provided then the animation will happen based on the originElement's position. originElement is optional.\n```javascript\nvar modalElement = document.getElementById(\"modalElem\");\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"transition\",{\"animation\":\"slideFromRight\",\"duration\":\"0.6\"});\n\nFor zoom with originElement -\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"transition\",{\"animation\":\"zoom\",\"duration\":\"0.6\",\"originElement\":\"#selector\"});\n\nFor zoom without originElement -\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"transition\",{\"animation\":\"zoom\",\"duration\":\"0.6\"});\n```\nFreeze\n\nSetting freeze false, will open a modaless modal. Dimmer will not be applied and backround view will be accessible. By default freeze will be true.\nNote : By default non-freezed modal will have inner scroll in the content area, if the modal's height/width exceeds the document's height/width.\n\n```javascript\nvar modalElement = document.getElementById(\"modalElem\");\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"freeze\",true);\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"freeze\",false);\n```\nOffset\n\nOffset property will help you to position the modal relative to the body. You can specify top and left offset for the modal using this property. \"%\" and \"px\" units are supported and you can also give 'center' if you want to position it in the center.\nNOTE: If Right and Bottom values present, it will override Left and Top values.\n\n```javascript\nvar modalElement = document.getElementById(\"modalElem\");\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"offset\",{\"top\":\"20px\",\"left\":\"center\"});\n```\nDraggable - Scrollable\n\nCheck the below checkboxes to make the modal draggable or scrollable.\n\n```javascript\nvar modalElement = document.getElementById(\"modalElem\");\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"draggable\",true);\nmodalElement.ltProp(\"scrollable\",true);\n```\nSet Content Height\n\nltPropSetContentHeight is a boolean property which determines if the content of the modal will have some fixed height or not. This property is helpful when you have set some height for the modal component. Toggle the below true/false value to check the difference.\n\n```html\n<lyte-modal lt-prop-set-content-height=\"true\" ></lyte-modal>\n```\nOverlap Modal\n\nltPropOverlapModal is a boolean property that determines if the incoming modal will be rendered sidewise or it will overlap the existing modal.\n\n```html\n<lyte-modal lt-prop-overlap-modal=\"true\" ></lyte-modal>\n```\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

Make sure the width and height of the popover is less than the place available when you use this option else it can lead to abnormal positioning of the popover. New values are added such as leftCenter, leftBottom, rightCenter, rightBottom. You can also provide different values in the following format, Eg - lt-prop-placement=\"left topRight\". So in this case first the popover will be positioned at the left of the origin element. If the popover cannot be placed there then it will try for the next position i.e. topRight.\nDimmer\nName\t:\tdimmer( lt-prop-dimmer )\nDataType\t:\tobject\nDefault\t:\t{\"color\":\"#000\",\"opacity\":\"0.4\"}\nDescription\t:\tThis property helps you to set the dimmer color and opacity for the freeze layer.\nDraggable\nName\t:\tdraggable( lt-prop-draggable )\nDataType\t:\tboolean\nDefault\t:\tfalse\nDescription\t:\tSet this property true to make the popover draggable.\nAllow Multiple\nName\t:\tallow-multiple( lt-prop-allow-multiple )\nDataType\t:\tboolean\nDefault\t:\tfalse\nDescription\t:\tThis property helps you to open any other popover/alert/popover over them.

When you provide origin element, it's clientRect object is calculated and the popover is positioned based on that. But if you don't have an origin element, based on the given offset value, the imaginary origin element will be calculated and the popover will be displayed. This offset value is not set to the popover. In case you haven't provided value for both lt-prop-origin-elem and lt-prop-offset, an error will be thrown. The width and height must be given in the lt-prop-offset.\nBind To Body\nName\t:\tbind-to-body( lt-prop-bind-to-body )\nDataType\t:\tboolean\nDefault\t:\tfalse\nDescription\t:\tIf set to true, renders the popover while loading the content of the page else the popover will be rendered when it's show value is set to true. Users can also set this value to false to remove the rendered popover from the DOM. NOTE : This value is required to be set from script when doing some action or it can be set using the methods provided by popover like on-close or on-before-close. Setting this value from html won't do the changes as expected.\nHeader Padding\nName\t:\theader-padding( lt-prop-header-padding )\nDataType\t:\tstring\nDefault\t:\t15px 30px\nDescription\t:\tSets padding for the header.\nContent Padding\nName\t:\tcontent-padding( lt-prop-content-padding )\nDataType\t:\tstring\nDefault\t:\t15px 30px\nDescription\t:\tSets padding for the content.\nFooter Padding\nName\t:\tfooter-padding( lt-prop-footer-padding )\nDataType\t:\tstring\nDefault\t:\t15px 30px\nDescription\t:\tSets padding for the footer.\nAnimation\nName\t:\tanimation( lt-prop-animation )\nDataType\t:\tstring\nDefault\t:\tfade\nDescription\t:\tSets animation to be shown while opening and closing the popover.\nWindow Spacing\nName\t:\twindow-spacing( lt-prop-window-spacing )\nDataType\t:\tobject\nDefault\t:\t{left : 30, right : 30, top : 30, bottom : 30}\nDescription\t:\tSets the gap that will be maintained between the popover and the browser's viewport. The values provided should be greater than 0(zero).\nForce Scroll\nName\t:\tforce-scroll( lt-prop-force-scroll )\nDataType\t:\tboolean\nDefault\t:\tfalse\nDescription\t:\tGenerally when the origin element goes out of the viewport the popover is either closed or it does not get scrolled further and remains inside the viewport. But setting this property to true will not close the popover and will keep the popover scrolling with the orign element in the webpage.\nAuto Align\nName\t:\tauto-align( lt-prop-auto-align )\nDataType\t:\tboolean\nDefault\t:\tfalse\nDescription\t:\tIf set to true it will observe the changes in height and width of the popover and will position it accordingly.\nAria\nName\t:\taria( lt-prop-aria )\nDataType\t:\tboolean\nDefault\t:\tfalse\nDescription\t:\tSetting this to true indicates that aria properties are provided and the same will be added to the popover element.\nAria Attributes\nName\t:\taria-attributes( lt-prop-aria-attributes )\nDataType\t:\tobject\nDescription\t:\tThe aria properties to be provided to the popover element are provided using this property.\nPrevent Focus\nName\t:\tprevent-focus( lt-prop-prevent-focus )\nDataType\t:\tboolean\nDefault\t:\tfalse\nDescription\t:\tIf set to true, it will prevent intial focus on elements inside the popover that is set by the popover. It is useful in those scenarios where any element rendered inside the popover has ltPropAutoFocus as true.\nStop Click\nName\t:\tstop-click( lt-prop-stop-click )\nDataType\t:\tboolean\nDefault\t:\tfalse\nDescription\t:\tSetting this to true indicates that the popover's click event handler should not perform any calculation. This is helpful when we are having some draggable item(s) inside the popover and the mouse pointer goes outside the popover's body while dragging an item. So in that position where the cursor is outside, if mouse up happens, the click function is also triggered. And as the click seems to happen outside the popover's body, so the popover gets closed(if it has lt-prop-close-on-body-click = true). This scenario can be prevented using ltPropStopClick property.\nMargin\nName\t:\tmargin( lt-prop-margin )\nDataType\t:\tobject\nDefault\t:\t\nDescription\t:\tWe can specify the offset distance between the popover and the origin element using this property.

Hence, after the popover is opened and if its content is changed then the popover's position won't change. So if you want to change the popover's position based on your updated content then call this function after your content is updated.\ncalculateOffset\nDescription\t:\tThe height and width of the popover is calculated while opening the popover based on its content at that time. So after opening the popover if the content is changed then there might not be any changes in the popover. Use this function if you want the popover reflect the changes in the content on its height and width too. Call this function after your content is updated.\ntrapFocus\nDescription\t:\tIt will trap the focus inside the popover.\nEvents\n\nThe following are the events of popover.\n\nBeforeOpen\nDescription\t:\tThis event is triggered before opening the popover.\nBeforeClose\nDescription\t:\tThis event is triggered before closing the popover.\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

    "order": 310,
    "content": "Build Configuration\n\nThe sLyte application is built based on the procedures mentioned in the build.js file, which can be found at build/build.js in the application directory. CLI also gives you the flexibility to add any configuration or any task that needs to be executed during the build process.\n\nFolder Structure\n\nbuild\n\nbuild.js /* Procedures for building the application */\n\nConfiguring the build options\n\nThis function is used to set the outputFolder which contains the compiled files. By default, CLI provides it under the dist folder. You can also recieve the complied files from the CLI in any folder of your choice.\n\n```javascript\nsetCustomConfiguration : function(options) {\n    options.customConfig = {\n        outputFolder : \"dist\"\n    }\n}\n```\nInitiating the build process\n\nIn this method, the compilation process will be intiated. You can also write a custom function to be executed before and after build process. The custom function which has to be executed before the build process must be specified before the init and the custom function that has to be executed after the build process must be specified after the build.\n\n```javascript\nbuild : async function (options)  {\n    buildUtils = require(path.join(options.cliRoot,'lib','utilities','buildUtils'));\n    /* Building of modules starts. Custom modules can be added in build function.*/\n    await buildUtils.init(options); /* Provides options to buildUtils.*/\n    await buildUtils.build(options);\n},\n```\nDefault build procedures\n\nBy default, CLI incorporates the routes and components. If your application has any helpers, mixers or any files that has to taken into consideration while building, you can mention it in build.js. Now let us see what happens while building the routes and components.\n\nBuilding routes:\n\nThe routes that has been mentioned in map.js gets imported and gets compiled automatically.\n\nBuilding components:\n\nWhile building the components, CLI bundles the template files, style files and the JS files into a single JS file. Based on your requirements, CLI gives you an option to bundle the CSS files along the the JS files. You can set the property 'includeStyle: true' to bundle it and set the property 'includeStyle: false' to consider not bundling the CSS and the JS files.\n\n```javascript\nincludeStyle : true /* toggle this boolean to include style into component's javascript file */\n```\n\nRather than bundling the CSS file, you can also use the link tag just like the below code snippet.\n\n```javascript\nincludeLinkTag=true;\n```\n\nOn doing so, the css file will be added as a link tag to the JS file. And now in the dist folder you can see the JS and the CSS file.\n\n```javascript\nisBaseHref=true;\n```\n\nOn setting isBaseHref true, the leading forward slash (/) is removed from absolute paths to support <base> tag in HTML.\n\nLet us see an example with and without isBaseHref\n\n```javascript\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/styles/main.css\">>\n```\n```javascript\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles/main.css\">\n```\nWatching for file changes\n\nA Watcher watches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions of files and directories. Changes in components, routes, models, and configuration JSON files are watched, and they are built once again if changes occur. You can also write custom watcher function to watch the files. And that particular file, requiring watcher function must require sane in build.js. Have a look at the below code to see how the custom watcher function works.\n\nobj (object)\npath (String) path of the directory to watch\nignored (optional) (Array) a glob, regex, or file path to ignore from watching\nglob (optional) (Array) a single string glob pattern to watch\n```javascript\nvar obj = {\n    path : options.root ,\n    ignored : [\n        '/bower_components/' ,\n        '/node-modules/'\n    ] ,\n    glob : [ '**/*.css' , '**/*.js' ]\n}\nvar sane=require('sane');\n/* sane is the npm package for watching the files */\nvar watcher = sane ( obj.path , {\n    glob : obj.glob ,\n    ignored : obj.ignored\n} ) ;\nwatcher.on ( 'change' , function ( filePath , root , stat ) {\n    /* code to execute when the file changes */\n} ) ;\nwatcher.on ( 'add' , function ( filePath , root , stat ) {\n    /* code to execute when the file new added */\n} ) ;\nwatcher.on ( 'delete' , function ( filePath , root , stat ) {\n    /* code to execute when the file deleted */\n} ) ;\n```\nAvailable utilities\nSlicer\n\nThis feature helps the CLI to let know that certain lines of code are not to be considered when it is indicated with @Slicer.someStart and @Slicer.somesEnd.\n\nTo enable this feature, add the below code in the setCustomConfiguration in your build.js file\n\n```javascript\noptions.slicer ={\n some:false\n}\n```\n\nWhere, 'some' can be any key inside the slicer object. If 'some' is set false or undefined, the code within the specified markers will be removed. This feature can be used as a single lined comment and multi lined commet just like the below code snippet.\n\n```html\nvar a=number;\n// @Slicer.someStart\nvar a=\"str\";\nconsole.log(a);\n// @Slicer.someEnd\nconsole.log(a)\n```\n```javascript\nvar a=number;\n/* @Slicer.someStart */\nvar a=\"str\";\nconsole.log(a);\n/*  @Slicer.someEnd */\nconsole.log(a)\n```\n```javascript\nvar a=number;\nconsole.log(a)\n```\n\nIn the production mode, the 'development' key in the slicer object is set as false. As set false, the code given with the @Slicer.developmentStart and @Slicer.developmentEnd, when given by the user will not be considered in the production mode.\n\nIn the development mode, the 'production' key in the slicer object is set as false. As set false, the code given with the @Slicer.productionStart and @Slicer.productionEnd, when given by the user will not be considered in the development mode.\n\nError Handling: If a user attempts to use $ in a slicer key, an error will be thrown as $ denotes internal slicer.\n\nProxy configuration\n\nLet us consider an example, where the data is residing in different server. Now, the request that is being intiated from your app gets redirected to the server with the help of options.devserver.\n\nLet us consider an example, where you have an route called as api of someapp serving at port 4000. Now, if you want to access the data of that particular api, you can set the options.devServer in your main app. Now from your main app you can access the api route and get it rendered in any different port of your choice.\n\n```javascript\noptions.devServer={\n\tproxy:[{\n\t\tcontext:['/api'], //Name of your request\n\t\ttarget:'http://local:2000' //destination for the request\n\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\nDebugging configuration\n\nThere are cases where you feel the need to debug the variables that has been imported and used in a file. To support such feature, CLI makes all the imported variables available in \"_\" during the file execution.\n\nIf \"_\" clashes with your any of your app's variable, then you can change the variable name as desired by setting the below configuration in your build.js using options.definePropertyVar\n\n```javascript\noptions.definePropertyVar = <<variableNameToBeChanged>>\n```\nSubresource Integrity\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.

This can be GET,PUT,POST,PATCH,etc.\n\n\nheaders\nType:\nObject\nDesc:\nThis is used to set headers for request. It is an object whose key is the request header name and value is the header value. This sets the X-Requested-With header by default with the value of XmlHttpRequest.\n\n\ndata\nType:\nPlainObject or String or Array\nDesc:\nThe data to be sent to the server. It is converted to a query string and is appended to the end of the URL in get requests. It is sent as form parameters in a POST request.\n\n\ndataType\nType:\nString\nDesc:\nThe datatype to which the response needs to be converted to. If no dataType is provided, lyte-dom will try to infer the dataType from the response mime type. These are the dataTypes that are available in lyte-dom - text, html, xml, json, script.\n\n\nsuccess\nType:\nFunction\nDesc:\nThe success callback is called when the request succeeds. It gets passed 3 parameters - the data from the server formatted according to the dataType parameter, the statusText of the response and the lXHR object.\n\n\nerror\nType:\nFunction\nDesc:\nThe error callback is called when the request fails. It gets passed 3 arguments - the lXHR object, the type of error( \"error\",\"timeout\" or \"abort\") and optional exception object.\n\n\ncomplete\nType:\nFunction\nDesc:\nThe complete callback is called when the request completes. It is passed in two arguments - the lXHR object and the status of the request\n\n\nmimeType\nType:\nString\nDesc:\nThis is used to override the XHR mime type.\n\n\ntimeout\nType:\nNumber\nDesc:\nIt is used to set a timeout for the request made. This takes in a value in milliseconds and waits for that specified time for the request to complete. If the request is not completed, then the request is timed out by lyte-dom. Timeout of 0 means no timeout.\n\n\ncontentType\nType:\nString\nDefault:\napplication/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8\nDesc:\nThis is used to set the content-type header of the request. By default, application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 is set as the content-type.\n\n\ncontents\nType:\nObject\nDesc:\nThis is used to map the content-type of the response to one of available data type converters. The user can pass his own custom dataType to ajax and can write his own text to dataType converter. The mimeType of the response needs to be mapped to this converter. This is achieved using the contents object. Key is the custom dataType name and value is a regular expression to test the mimeType against.\n\n\nasync\nType:\nBoolean\nDefault:\ntrue\nDesc:\nThe async attribute defines whether the request should be made synchronous or asynchronous. When it is set to false, the request is made synchronous, meaning all execution of javascript is stopped until the response is obtained. For these reasons, its generally better to use async true.\n\n\nglobal\nType:\nBoolean\nDefault:\ntrue\nDesc:\nThis is used to fire the global event handlers registered through lyte-dom. The global events here are the ajaxStart, ajaxSend, ajaxSuccess, ajaxComplete, ajaxStop and ajaxError. Set to false to prevent these events from getting triggered.\n\n\nconverters\nType:\nObject\nDesc:\nThis is used to convert text data to other forms of data. It is an object whose key is the dataType to dataType map( Eg: \"text html\" ) and value is the function to achieve the conversion. Currently, only text to other format converter is available.\n\n\ncontext\nType:\nObject\nDefault:\nOptions object which contains information about the request\nDesc:\nThis is the context of the ajax related callbacks in lyte-dom.\n\n\nxhrFields\nType:\nObject\nDesc:\nA key-value pair mapping where the key represents the properties of the XHR object so that the user can set his desired value. Use this to set the withCredentials field in XHR object.\n\n\nprocessData\nType:\nBoolean\nDefault:\ntrue\nDesc:\nBy default the data sent to the server is made to a query string matching the application/x-www-form-urlencoded content-type. If you want to pass in any other content to the server like a DOMDocument, set this parameter to false.\n\n\nbeforeSend\nType:\nFunction\nDesc:\nThe beforeSend callback is fired just before the ajax request is being made. Use this to prevent the ajax request by returning false. You can also use this to attach headers to the request.\n\n\ncache\nType:\nBoolean\nDefault:\ntrue\nDesc:\nThis is used to cache data of your HEAD and GET requests. By default, cache is set to true and browser caches your results. But when it is set to false, lyte-dom appends the _={timestamp} to the request url and forces the request to not be cached.\nLHXR Object properties\nThe lXHR object returned in the success/failure/complete callbacks has the following properties\nstatusText\nThe status text of the response ( OK, No Content, etc )\nstatus\nThe statusCode of the response( 200 - OK, 404 - Not Found, etc )\nsetRequestHeader( key, value )\nSet the request header for the XMLHttpRequest where the key is the request header name and value is header value.\nresponseText\nThe response of the request in the form of text.\nreadyState\nThe readyState value of the XmlHttpRequest.\noverrideMimeType( type )\nUsed to override the mimeType of the request.\ngetResponseHeader( key )\nGet the response header value of that particular key.\ngetAllResponseHeaders()\nGet all the response headers from the response\nabort( statusText )\nUsed to abort the request by passing a relevant statusText.\ndone( onSuccess )\nThis is fired when the request succeeds.\nfail( onFailure )\nThis is fired when the request fails.\nalways( onComplete )\nThis is fired when the request is complete.\nthen( onSuccess, onFailure )\nThe then function can take in the success and failure callbacks and execute them based on the request's status\nAjax Events\nLyte-Dom provides a set of handlers that are executed when they are registered and a request is made. The order of execution of these events are as follows\najaxStart\nThis is fired when the first ajax request is fired.\najaxSend\nThis is fired just before an ajax request is sent.\najaxSuccess\nThis is fired when an ajax request succeeds.\najaxError\nThis is fired when an ajax request fails.\najaxComplete\nThis is fired when an ajax request completes.\najaxStop\nThis is fired when all ajax requests are completed.\nSimple Overview:\nRequests by default in lyte-dom are sent as GET requests. If you want to send them as POST request specify the type attribute as POST. The object passed to a GET requested to converted to a query string and appended to the URL.Similarly, the object passed to the post request is attached to the request body after being converted to a query string. To prevent this from happening, use processData as false. Requests are also cached by default by the brower, set cache to false to prevent this from happening. Lyte-dom appends a _={timestamp} to the request which prevents it from getting cached. The dataType attribute is used to convert the response to the type specified. Use the callbacks( success, error and complete ) to handle the response sent from the server. The global attribute is used fire events during different stages of the events and the async attribute is used to determine whether the request should be synchronous or asynchronous. Request headers can be passed to the request using the headers option. You can also timeout requests by making use of the timeout attribute.\nExamples:\nThe example below demonstrates how an ajax request is made in lyte-dom. It makes a request to /users and gets a JSON response which is passed as a dataType. The success callback handles the request when it succeeds and the failure callback handles it when it fails. The complete callback is called either way.\nCode:\nSnippet\nIt is also possible to send data to the server in ajax by making use of the data parameter. This is demonstrated below\nCode:\nSnippet\n\nsLyte is a light weight, fast and memory efficient client framework designed to develop web application efficiently and reliably, which focuses on three main layers - router, component and data.
